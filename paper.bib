	Abstract = {Despite considerable efforts, description of molecular shape is still largely an unresolved problem. Given the importance of molecular shape in the description of spatial interactions in crystals or ligand-target complexes, this is not a satisfying state. In the current work, we propose a novel application of alpha shapes to the description of the shapes of small molecules. Alpha shapes are parametrized generalizations of the convex hull. For a specific value of alpha, the alpha shape is the geometric dual of the space-filling model of a molecule, with the parameter alpha allowing description of shape in varying degrees of detail. To date, alpha shapes have been used to find macromolecular cavities and to estimate molecular surface areas and volumes. We developed a novel methodology for computing molecular shape characteristics from the alpha shape. In this work, we show that alpha-shape descriptors reveal aspects of molecular shape that are complementary to other shape descriptors and that accord well with chemists' intuition about shape. While our implementation of alpha-shape descriptors is not computationally trivial, we suggest that the additional shape characteristics they provide can be used to improve and complement shape-analysis methods in domains such as crystallography and ligand-target interactions. In this communication, we present a unique methodology for computing molecular shape characteristics from the alpha shape. We first describe details of the alpha-shape calculation, an outline of validation experiments performed, and a discussion of the advantages and challenges we found while implementing this approach. The results show that, relative to known shape calculations, this method provides a high degree of shape resolution with even small changes in atomic coordinates.},

	Abstract = {Searching chemical databases for possible drug leads is often one of the main activities conducted during the early stages of a drug development project. This article shows that spherical harmonic molecular shape representations provide a powerful way to search and cluster small-molecule databases rapidly and accurately. Our clustering results show that chemically meaningful clusters may be obtained using only low order spherical harmonic expansions. Our database search results show that using low order spherical harmonic shape-based correlation techniques could provide a practical and efficient way to search very large 3D molecular databases, hence leading to a useful new approach for high throughput 3D virtual screening. The approach described is currently being extended to allow the rapid search and comparison of arbitrary combinations of molecular surface properties.},

@article{Zauhar:2003fk,
	Abstract = {A unifying principle of rational drug design is the use of either shape similarity or complementarity to identify compounds expected to be active against a given target. Shape similarity is the underlying foundation of ligand-based methods, which seek compounds with structure similar to known actives, while shape complementarity is the basis of most receptor-based design, where the goal is to identify compounds complementary in shape to a given receptor. These approaches can be extended to include molecular descriptors in addition to shape, such as lipophilicity or electrostatic potential. Here we introduce a new technique, which we call shape signatures, for describing the shape of ligand molecules and of receptor sites. The method uses a technique akin to ray-tracing to explore the volume enclosed by a ligand molecule, or the volume exterior to the active site of a protein. Probability distributions are derived from the ray-trace, and can be based solely on the geometry of the reflecting ray, or may include joint dependence on properties, such as the molecular electrostatic potential, computed over the surface. Our shape signatures are just these probability distributions, stored as histograms. They converge rapidly with the length of the ray-trace, are independent of molecular orientation, and can be compared quickly using simple metrics. Shape signatures can be used to test for both shape similarity between compounds and for shape complementarity between compounds and receptors and thus can be applied to problems in both ligand- and receptor-based molecular design. We present results for comparisons between small molecules of biological interest and the NCI Database using shape signatures under two different metrics. Our results show that the method can reliably extract compounds of shape (and polarity) similar to the query molecules. We also present initial results for a receptor-based strategy using shape signatures, with application to the design of new inhibitors predicted to be active against HIV protease.},

	Abstract = {An analysis method termed similarity search profiling has been developed to evaluate fingerprint-based virtual screening calculations. The analysis is based on systematic similarity search calculations using multiple template compounds over the entire value range of a similarity coefficient. In graphical representations, numbers of correctly identified hits and other detected database compounds are separately monitored. The resulting profiles make it possible to determine whether a virtual screening trial can in principle succeed for a given compound class, search tool, similarity metric, and selection criterion. As a test case, we have analyzed virtual screening calculations using a recently designed fingerprint on 23 different biological activity classes in a compound source database containing approximately 1.3 million molecules. Based on our predefined selection criteria, we found that virtual screening analysis was successful for 19 of 23 compound classes. Profile analysis also makes it possible to determine compound class-specific similarity threshold values for similarity searching.},

	Abstract = {MOTIVATION: Certain chemical substructures are present in many drugs. This has led to the claim of 'privileged' substructures which are predisposed to bioactivity. Because bias in screening library construction could explain this phenomenon, the existence of privilege has been controversial. RESULTS: Using diverse phenotypic assays, we defined bioactivity for multiple compound libraries. Many substructures were associated with bioactivity even after accounting for substructure prevalence in the library, thus validating the privileged substructure concept. Determinations of privilege were confirmed in independent assays and libraries. Our analysis also revealed 'underprivileged' substructures and 'conditional privilege'-rules relating combinations of substructure to bioactivity. Most previously reported substructures have been flat aromatic ring systems. Although we validated such substructures, we also identified three-dimensional privileged substructures. Most privileged substructures display a wide variety of substituents suggesting an entropic mechanism of privilege. Compounds containing privileged substructures had a doubled rate of bioactivity, suggesting practical consequences for pharmaceutical discovery.},

Because McGowan volumes are not available for ions, its application is limited to only neutral compounds. Pauling radii of metallic ions have been collected and studied to obtain McGowan volumes for ions. Regression analysis was carried out between Pauling radii (R(p)) and McGowan radii (R(x)) for a wide range of compounds. It was found that Pauling radii and McGowan radii derived from McGowan volumes by using a volume-radius formula are linearly related (R(x) = 1.115R(p) + 0.0623, r(2) = 0.995). This equation is then used to calculate McGowan volumes for various ions and charged groups. McGowan volumes have been calculated for inorganic, organic, and organometallic compounds and correlated with van der Waals volumes. Results show that McGowan volumes (V(x)) are entirely equivalent to computer-calculated van der Waals volumes.},

@article{Roy:2004uq,
	Abstract = {Considering the importance of quantitative structure-toxicity relationship (QSTR) studies in the field of aquatic toxicology from the viewpoint of ecological safety assessment, fish toxicity of various benzene derivatives has been modeled by the multiple regression technique using recently introduced extended topochemical atom (ETA) indices. The toxicity data have also been modeled using other selected topological descriptors and physicochemical variables, and the best ETA model has been compared to the non-ETA ones. Principal component factor analysis was used as the data preprocessing step to reduce the dimensionality of the data matrix and identify the important variables that are devoid of collinearities. All-possible-subsets regression was also applied on the parameters to cross-check the variable selection for the best model. Multiple linear regression analyses show that the best non-ETA model involves 1chi, ALogP98, and LUMO (energy) as predictor variables and the quality of the relation is as follows: n = 92, Q2 = 0.718, Ra2 = 0.730, R2 = 0.738, R = 0.859, F = 82.8 (df 3, 88), s = 0.340. On the other hand, the best ETA model has the following quality: n = 92, Q2 = 0.865, Ra2 = 0.876, R2 = 0.885, R = 0.941, F = 92.6 (df 7, 84), s = 0.230. The ETA relations showed positive contributions of molecular bulk (size), chloro and hydroxy substitutions in the benzene ring, and the simultaneous presence of methyl and nitro substitutions to the toxicity. Further, the presence of fluoro and ether functionality, amino or nitro functionality in an otherwise unsubstituted ring, and nitro functionality that is ortho to a chloro substituent decreases toxicity. An attempt to use non-ETA descriptors along with ETA ones did not improve the quality in comparison to the best ETA model. Interestingly, the ETA model developed presently for the fish toxicity is better than the previously reported models on the same data set. Thus, it appears that ETA descriptors have significant potential in QSAR/QSPR/QSTR studies, which warrants extensive evaluation.},

@article{Gupta:2010uq,
	Abstract = {Ligand-based computational models could be more readily shared between researchers and organizations if they were generated with open source molecular descriptors [e.g., chemistry development kit (CDK)] and modeling algorithms, because this would negate the requirement for proprietary commercial software. We initially evaluated open source descriptors and model building algorithms using a training set of approximately 50,000 molecules and a test set of approximately 25,000 molecules with human liver microsomal metabolic stability data. A C5.0 decision tree model demonstrated that CDK descriptors together with a set of Smiles Arbitrary Target Specification (SMARTS) keys had good statistics [κ = 0.43, sensitivity = 0.57, specificity = 0.91, and positive predicted value (PPV) = 0.64], equivalent to those of models built with commercial Molecular Operating Environment 2D (MOE2D) and the same set of SMARTS keys (κ = 0.43, sensitivity = 0.58, specificity = 0.91, and PPV = 0.63). Extending the dataset to ∼193,000 molecules and generating a continuous model using Cubist with a combination of CDK and SMARTS keys or MOE2D and SMARTS keys confirmed this observation. When the continuous predictions and actual values were binned to get a categorical score we observed a similar κ statistic (0.42). The same combination of descriptor set and modeling method was applied to passive permeability and P-glycoprotein efflux data with similar model testing statistics. In summary, open source tools demonstrated predictive results comparable to those of commercial software with attendant cost savings. We discuss the advantages and disadvantages of open source descriptors and the opportunity for their use as a tool for organizations to share data precompetitively, avoiding repetition and assisting drug discovery.},

By incorporating an N,N'-diaryl urea moiety at the C4-position of 3-aminodazole, a series of RTK inhibitors were generated, which potently inhibited the tyrosine kinase activity of the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor and the platelet-derived growth factor receptor families. A number of compounds with potent oral activity were identified by utilizing an estradiol-induced mouse uterine edema model and an HT1080 human fibrosarcoma xenograft tumor model. In particular, compound 17p (ABT-869) was found to possess favorable pharmacokinetic profiles across different species and display significant tumor growth inhibition in multiple preclinical animal models.},

	Abstract = {Adenosine has been suggested to induce bronchial hyperresponsiveness in asthmatics, which is believed to be an A(2B) adenosine receptor (AdoR) mediated pathway. We hypothesize that a selective, high-affinity A(2B) AdoR antagonist may provide therapeutic benefit in the treatment of asthma. In an attempt to identify a high-affinity, selective antagonist for the A(2B) AdoR, we synthesized 8-(C-4-pyrazolyl) xanthines. Compound 22, 8-(1H-pyrazol-4-yl)-1,3-dipropyl xanthine, is a N-1 unsubstituted pyrazole derivative that has favorable binding affinity (K(i) = 9 nM) for the A(2B) AdoR, but it is only 2-fold selective versus the A(1) AdoR. Introduction of a benzyl group at the N-1-pyrazole position of 22 resulted in 19, which had moderate selectivity. The initial focus of the SAR study was on the preparation of substituted benzyl derivatives of 19 because the corresponding phenyl, phenethyl, and phenpropyl derivatives showed a decrease in A(2B) AdoR affinity and selectivity relative to 19. The preferred substitution on the phenyl ring of 19 contains an electron-withdrawing group, specifically F or CF(3) at the m-position, as in 33 and 36 respectively, increases the selectivity while retaining the affinity for the A(2B) AdoR. Exploring disubstitutions on the phenyl ring of derivatives 33 and36 led to the 2-chloro-5-trifluoromethylphenyl derivative 50, which retained the A(2B) AdoR affinity but enhanced the selectivity relative to 36. After optimization of the substitution on the 8-pyrazole xanthine, 1,3-disubstitution of the xanthine core was explored with methyl, ethyl, butyl, and isobutyl groups. In comparison to the corresponding dipropyl analogues, the smaller 1,3-dialkyl groups (methyl and ethyl) increased the A(2B) AdoR binding selectivity of the xanthine derivatives while retaining the affinity. However, the larger 1,3-dialkyl groups (isobutyl and butyl) resulted in a decrease in both A(2B) AdoR affinity and selectivity. This final SAR optimization led to the discovery of 1,3-dimethyl derivative 60, 8-(1-(3-(trifluoromethyl) benzyl)-1H-pyrazol-4-yl)-1,3-dimethyl xanthine, a high-affinity (K(i) = 1 nM) A(2B) AdoR antagonist with high selectivity (990-, 690-, and 1,000-) for the human A(1), A(2A,) and A(3) AdoRs.},

@article{Costanzo:2005uq,
	Abstract = {Thrombin inhibitors are potentially useful in medicine for their anticoagulant and antithrombotic effects. We synthesized and evaluated diverse heterocycle-activated ketones based on the d-Phe-Pro-Arg, and related thrombin active-site recognition motifs, as candidate inhibitors. The peptide-based alpha-ketoheterocycles were typically prepared by either an imidate or a Weinreb amide route (Schemes 1 and 2), the latter of which proved to be more general. Test compounds were generally assayed for inhibition of human alpha-thrombin and bovine trypsin. From a structure-based design standpoint, the heterocycle allows one to explore and adjust interactions within the S1' subsite of thrombin. The preferred alpha-ketoheterocycle is a pi-rich 2-substituted azole with at least two heteroatoms proximal to the carbon bearing the keto group, and a preferred thrombin inhibitor is 2-ketobenzothiazole 3, with a potent K(i) value of 0.2 nM and ca. 15-fold selectivity over trypsin. 2-Ketobenzothiazole 13 exhibited exceedingly potent thrombin inhibition (K(i) = 0.000 65 nM; slow tight binding). Several alpha-ketoheterocycles had thrombin K(i) values in the range 0.1-400 nM. The "Arg" unit in the alpha-ketoheterocycles can be sensitive to stereomutation under mildy basic conditions. For example, 2-ketothiazoles 4 and 59 readily epimerize at pH 7.4, although they are fairly stable stereochemically at pH 3-4; thus, suitable conditions had to be selected for the enzymatic assays. Lead d-Phe-Pro-Arg 2-benzothiazoles 3, 4, and 68 displayed good selectivity for thrombin over other key coagulation enzymes (e.g., factor Xa, plasmin, protein Ca, uPA, tPA, and streptokinase); however, their selectivity for thrombin over trypsin was modest (<25-fold). Compounds 3, 4, and 68 exhibited potent in vitro antithrombotic activity as measured by inhibition of gel-filtered platelet aggregation induced by alpha-thrombin (IC(50) = 30-40 nM). They also proved to be potent anticoagulant/antithrombotic agents in vivo on intravenous administration, as determined in the canine arteriovenous shunt (ED(50) = 0.45-0.65 mg/kg) and the rabbit deep vein thrombosis (ED(50) = 0.1-0.4 mg/kg) models. Intravenous administration of 3, and several analogues, to guinea pigs caused hypotension and electrocardiogram abnormalities. Such cardiovascular side effects were also observed with some nonguanidine inhibitors and inhibitors having recognition motifs other than d-Phe-Pro-Arg. 2-Benzothiazolecarboxylates 4 and 68 exhibited significantly diminished cardiovascular side effects, and benzothiazolecarboxylic acid 4 had the best profile with respect to therapeutic index. The X-ray crystal structures of the ternary complexes 3-thrombin-hirugen and 4-thrombin-hirugen depict novel interactions in the S(1)' region, with the benzothiazole ring forming a hydrogen bond with His-57 and an aromatic stacking interaction with Trp-60D of thrombin's insertion loop. The benzothiazole ring of 3 displaces the Lys-60F side chain into a U-shaped gauche conformation, whereas the benzothiazole carboxylate of 4 forms a salt bridge with the side chain of Lys-60F such that it adopts an extended anti conformation. Since 3 has a 10-fold greater affinity for thrombin than does 4, any increase in binding energy resulting from this salt bridge is apparently offset by perturbations across the enzyme (viz. Figure 4). The increased affinity and selectivity of 2-ketobenzothiazole inhibitors, such as 3, may be primarily due to the aromatic stacking interaction with Trp-60D. However, energy contour calculations with the computer program GRID also indicate a favorable interaction between the benzothiazole sulfur atom and a hydrophobic patch on the surface of thrombin.},

	Abstract = {We present a novel generic method to better understand the divergent activities of molecules that often occur in orthogonal assays. The newly developed simple prediction of activity differences (SPREAD) method directly aims to model and understand the differences compounds exhibit when tested in two or more assays. By transforming the activity values from the assays into meta-categories (specifically defined for datasets under scrutiny), statistical models can be trained directly on the qualitative differences between assays. This contributes heavily toward a tangible understanding of molecular assay selectivity. Although ensembles of models could be used alternatively to predict compounds that score highly in one assay and low in another, the advantage of the SPREAD approach is that the chemical features influencing assay differences are parsed out immediately as a consequence of training the model on the coincident assay differences. By training the model that describes the difference between two or more assays, molecular substructures that are responsible for assay selectivity can be parsed out. The method was validated by using four challenging datasets. Copyright 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc., Statistical Analysis and Data Mining 2: 115-122, 2009},

	Abstract = {A series of chiral non-racemic dexoxadrol analogues with various substituents in position 4 of the piperidine ring was synthesized and pharmacologically evaluated. Only the enantiomers having (S)-configuration at the 2-position of the piperidine ring and 4-position of the dioxolane ring were considered. Key steps in the synthesis were an imino-Diels-Alder reaction of enantiomerically pure imine (S)-13, which had been obtained from d-mannitol, with Danishefsky's Diene 14 and the replacement of the p-methoxybenzyl protective group with a Cbz-group. It was shown that (S,S)-configuration of the ring junction (position 2 of the piperidine ring and position 4 of the dioxolane ring) and axial orientation of the C-4-substituent ((4S)-configuration) are crucial for high NMDA receptor affinity. 2-(2,2-Diphenyl-1,3-dioxolan-4-yl)piperidines with a hydroxy moiety ((S,S,S)-5, K(i)=28nM), a fluorine atom ((S,S,S)-6, WMS-2539, K(i)=7nM) and two fluorine atoms ((S,S)-7, K(i)=48nM) in position 4 represent the most potent NMDA antagonists with high selectivity against σ(1) and σ(2) receptors and the polyamine binding site of the NMDA receptor. The NMDA receptor affinities of the new ligands were correlated with their electrostatic potentials, calculated gas phase proton affinities (negative enthalpies of deprotonation) and dipole moments. According to these calculations decreasing proton affinity and increasing dipole moment are correlated with decreasing NMDA receptor affinity.},

	Abstract = {Up to now, very few reports have been published concerning the application of multiobjective optimization (MOOP) techniques to quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) studies. However, none reports the optimization of objectives related directly to the desired pharmaceutical profile of the drug. In this work, for the first time, it is proposed a MOOP method based on Derringer's desirability function that allows conducting global QSAR studies considering simultaneously the pharmacological, pharmacokinetic and toxicological profile of a set of molecule candidates. The usefulness of the method is demonstrated by applying it to the simultaneous optimization of the analgesic, antiinflammatory, and ulcerogenic properties of a library of fifteen 3-(3-methylphenyl)-2-substituted amino-3H-quinazolin-4-one compounds. The levels of the predictor variables producing concurrently the best possible compromise between these properties is found and used to design a set of new optimized drug candidates. Our results also suggest the relevant role of the bulkiness of alkyl substituents on the C-2 position of the quinazoline ring over the ulcerogenic properties for this family of compounds. Finally, and most importantly, the desirability-based MOOP method proposed is a valuable tool and shall aid in the future rational design of novel successful drugs.},

@article{Nicolotti:2009fk,
	Abstract = {A multiobjective optimization algorithm was proposed for the automated integration of structure- and ligand-based molecular design. Driven by a genetic algorithm, the herein proposed approach enabled the detection of a number of trade-off QSAR models accounting simultaneously for two independent objectives. The first was biased toward best regressions among docking scores and biological affinities; the second minimized the atom displacements from a properly established crystal-based binding topology. Based on the concept of dominance, 3D QSAR equivalent models profiled the Pareto frontier and were, thus, designated as nondominated solutions of the search space. K-means clustering was, then, operated to select a representative subset of the available trade-off models. These were effectively subjected to GRID/GOLPE analyses for quantitatively featuring molecular determinants of ligand binding affinity. More specifically, it was demonstrated that a) diverse binding conformations occurred on the basis of the ligand ability to profitably contact different part of protein binding site; b) enzyme selectivity was better approached and interpreted by combining diverse equivalent models; and c) trade-off models were successful and even better than docking virtual screening, in retrieving at high sensitivity active hits from a large pool of chemically similar decoys. The approach was tested on a large series, very well-known to QSAR practitioners, of 3-amidinophenylalanine inhibitors of thrombin and trypsin, two serine proteases having rather different biological actions despite a high sequence similarity.},

The rich visual analytics of Scaffold Explorer afford the user a "bird's-eye" view of the chemical space spanned by a particular data set, map any physicochemical property or biological activity of interest onto the individual scaffold nodes, serve as an aggregator for the properties of the compounds represented by these nodes, and quickly distinguish promising chemotypes from less interesting or problematic ones. Unlike previous approaches, which focused on automated extraction and classification of scaffolds, the utility of the new tool rests on its interactivity and ability to accommodate the medicinal chemists' intuition by allowing the use of arbitrary substructures containing variable atoms, bonds, and/or substituents such as those employed in substructure search.},

	Abstract = {ADMET Models, whether in silico or in vitro, are commonly used to 'profile' molecules, to identify potential liabilities or filter out molecules expected to have undesirable properties. While useful, this is the most basic application of such models. Here, we will show how models may be used to go 'beyond profiling' to guide key decisions in drug discovery. For example, selection of chemical series to focus resources with confidence or design of improved molecules targeting structural modifications to improve key properties. To prioritise molecules and chemical series, the success criteria for properties and their relative importance to a project's objective must be defined. Data from models (experimental or predicted) may then be used to assess each molecule's balance of properties against those requirements. However, to make decisions with confidence, the uncertainties in all of the data must also be considered. In silico models encode information regarding the relationship between molecular structure and properties. This is used to predict the property value of a novel molecule. However, further interpretation can yield information on the contributions of different groups in a molecule to the property and the sensitivity of the property to structural changes. Visualising this information can guide the redesign process. In this article, we describe methods to achieve these goals and drive drug-discovery decisions and illustrate the results with practical examples.},

Two particularly pernicious ones are cum hoc ergo propter hoc (with this, therefore because of this) and confirmation bias (seeking evidence that is confirmatory of the hypothesis at hand).

The search was carried out with a Web browser available at  www.gdb.unibe.ch . This virtual screening procedure selected 31 504 analogs of nicotine from GDB-13, from which 48 were known nicotinic ligands reported in Chembl. An additional 60 virtual screening hits were purchased and tested for modulation of the acetylcholine signal at the human α7 nAChR expressed in  Xenopus  oocytes, which led to the identification of three previously unknown inhibitors.

	Abstract = {Predictive models are widely used in computer-aided drug discovery, particularly for identifying potentially biologically active molecules based on training sets of compounds with known activity or inactivity. The use of these models (amongst others) has enabled "virtual screens" to be used to identify compounds in large data sets that are predicted to be active, and which would thus be good candidates for experimental testing. The PubChem BioAssay database contains an increasing amount of experimental data from biological screens that has the potential to be used to train predictive models for a wide range of assays and targets, yet there has been little work carried out on using this data to build models. In this paper, we take an initial look at this by investigating the quality of naive Bayesian predictive models built using BioAssay data, and find that overall the predictive quality of such models is good, indicating that they could have utility in virtual screening.},

@article{Shen:2011zr,
	Abstract = {The human ether-a-go-go related gene (hERG) potassium ion channel plays a key role in cardiotoxicity and is therefore a key target as part of preclinical drug discovery toxicity screening. The PubChem hERG Bioassay data set, composed of 1668 compounds, was used to construct an in silico screening model. The corresponding trial models were constructed from a descriptor pool composed of 4D fingerprints (4D-FP) and traditional 2D and 3D VolSurf-like molecular descriptors. A final binary classification model was constructed via a support vector machine (SVM). The resultant model was then validated using the PubChem hERG Bioassay data set (AID 376) and an external hERG data set by evaluating the model's ability to determine hERG blockers from nonblockers. The external data set (the test set) consisted of 356 compounds collected from available literature data and consisting of 287 actives and 69 inactives. Four different sampling protocols and a 10-fold cross-correlation analysis--used in the validation process to evaluate classification models--explored the impact of the active--inactive data imbalance distribution of the PubChem high-throughput data set. Four different data sets were explored, and the one employing Lipinski's rule-of-five coupled with measures of relative molecular lipophilicity performed the best in the 10-fold cross-correlation validation of the training data set as well as overall prediction accuracy of the external test sets. The linear SVM binary classification model building strategy was applied to different combinations of MOE (traditional 2D, "21/2D", and 3D VolSurf-like) and 4D-FP molecular descriptors to further explore and refine previously proposed key descriptors, identify new significant features that contribute to the prediction of hERG toxicity, and construct the optimal SVM binary classification model from a shrunken descriptor pool. The accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of the best model determined from 10-fold cross-validation are 95, 90, and 96\%, respectively; the overall accuracy is near 87\% for the external set. The models constructed in this study demonstrate the following: (i) robustness based upon performance in accuracy across the structural diversity of the training set, (ii) ability to predict a compound's "predisposition" to block hERG ion channels, and (iii) define and illustrate structural features that can be overlaid onto the chemical structures to aid in the 3D structure-activity interpretation of the hERG blocking effect.},

CYP1A2 is an important member of CYP450 superfamily and accounts for 15\% of total CYP450 presence in human liver. This article compares 80 in-silico QSAR models that were created by following the same procedure with different combinations of descriptors and machine learning methods. The training and test sets consist of 3745 and 3741 inhibitors and noninhibitors from PubChem BioAssay database. A heterogeneous external test set of 160 inhibitors was collected from literature. The studied descriptor sets involve E-state, Dragon and ISIDA SMF descriptors. Machine learning methods involve Associative Neural Networks (ASNN), K Nearest Neighbors (kNN), Random Tree (RT), C4.5 Tree (J48), and Support Vector Machines (SVM). The influence of descriptor selection on model accuracy was studied. The benefits of "bagging" modeling approach were shown. Applicability domain approach was successfully applied in this study and ways of increasing model accuracy through use of applicability domain measures were demonstrated as well as fragment-based model interpretation was performed. The most accurate models in this study achieved values of 83\% and 68\% correctly classified instances on the internal and external test sets, respectively. The applicability domain approach allowed increasing the prediction accuracy to 90\% for 78\% of the internal and 17\% of the external test sets, respectively.

	Abstract = {Empirical methods for building predictive models of the relationships between molecular structure and useful properties are becoming increasingly important. This has arisen because drug discovery and development have become more complex. A large amount of biological target information is becoming available through molecular biology. Automation of chemical synthesis and pharmacological screening has also provided a vast amount of experimental data. Tools for designing libraries and extracting information from molecular databases and high-throughput screening experiments robustly and quickly enable leads to be discovered more effectively. As drug leads progress down the development pipeline, the ability to predict physicochemical, pharmacokinetic and toxicological properties of these leads is becoming increasingly important in reducing the number of expensive, late development failures. Quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) methods have much to offer in these areas. However, QSAR analysis has many traps for unwary practitioners. This review introduces the concepts behind QSAR, points out problems that may be encountered, suggests ways of avoiding the pitfalls and introduces several exciting, new QSAR methods discovered during the last decade.},

	Abstract = {We present a novel technique for a fast chemical substructure search on a relational database by use of a standard SQL query. The symmetry of a query graph is analyzed to give additional constraints. Our method is based on breadth-first search (BFS) algorithms implementation using Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMS). In addition to the chemical search we apply our technique to the field of intermolecular interactions which involves nonplanar graphs and describe how to achieve linear time performance along with the suggestion on how to sufficiently reduce the linear coefficient. From the algorithms theory perspective these results mean that subgraph isomorphism is a polynomial time problem, hence equal problems have the same complexity. The application to subgraph isomorphism in chemical search is available at http://www.ebi.ac.uk/msd-srv/chemsearch and http://www.ebi.ac.uk/msd-srv/msdmotif/chem . The application to the network of molecule interactions is available at http://www.ebi.ac.uk/msd-srv/msdmotif .},

	Abstract = {Efficient substructure searching is a key requirement for any chemical information management system. In this paper, we describe the substructure search capabilities of ABCD, an integrated drug discovery informatics platform developed at Johnson \& Johnson Pharmaceutical Research \& Development, L.L.C. The solution consists of several algorithmic components: 1) a pattern mapping algorithm for solving the subgraph isomorphism problem, 2) an indexing scheme that enables very fast substructure searches on large structure files, 3) the incorporation of that indexing scheme into an Oracle cartridge to enable querying large relational databases through SQL, and 4) a cost estimation scheme that allows the Oracle cost-based optimizer to generate a good execution plan when a substructure search is combined with additional constraints in a single SQL query. The algorithm was tested on a public database comprising nearly 1 million molecules using 4,629 substructure queries, the vast majority of which were submitted by discovery scientists over the last 2.5 years of user acceptance testing of ABCD. 80.7\% of these queries were completed in less than a second and 96.8\% in less than ten seconds on a single CPU, while on eight processing cores these numbers increased to 93.2\% and 99.7\%, respectively. The slower queries involved extremely generic patterns that returned the entire database as screening hits and required extensive atom-by-atom verification.},

Here we review some recent advances in network and systems biology applied to human health, and discuss how they can have a big impact on some of the most interesting areas of drug discovery. In particular, we claim that network biology will play a central part in the development of novel polypharmacology strategies to fight complex multifactorial diseases, where efficacious therapies will need to center on altering entire pathways rather than single proteins. We briefly present new developments in the two areas where we believe network and system biology strategies are more likely to have an immediate contribution: predictive toxicology and drug repurposing.},

We demonstrate the combination of drug and xenobiotic metabolism prediction, quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models and structural similarity searching to generate a list of similar compounds to, and possible targets for novel compounds. These lists of compounds and proteins are mapped to functional ontologies such as gene-disease associations, biological processes, and mechanisms of toxicity, and can be used to reconstruct biological networks linking together the component nodes into biologically-meaningful clusters. Thus, an assessment of biological effects can be made early in the discovery and development process that can be used to prioritize the best compounds for additional testing or development, or to direct efforts in medicinal chemistry to improve compound activity profiles.},

	Abstract = {The increasing cost of drug development is partially due to our failure to identify undesirable compounds at an early enough stage of development. The application of higher throughput screening methods have resulted in the generation of very large datasets from cells in vitro or from in vivo experiments following the treatment with drugs or known toxins. In recent years the development of systems biology, databases and pathway software has enabled the analysis of the high-throughput data in the context of the whole cell. One of the latest technology paradigms to be applied alongside the existing in vitro and computational models for absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion and toxicology (ADME/Tox) involves the integration of complex multidimensional datasets, termed toxicogenomics. The goal is to provide a more complete understanding of the effects a molecule might have on the entire biological system. However, due to the sheer complexity of this data it may be necessary to apply one or more different types of computational approaches that have as yet not been fully utilized in this field. The present review describes the data generated currently and introduces computational approaches as a component of ADME/Tox. These methods include network algorithms and manually curated databases of interactions that have been separately classified under systems biology methods. The integration of these disparate tools will result in systems-ADME/Tox and it is important to understand exactly what data resources and technologies are available and applicable. Examples of networks derived with important drug transporters and drug metabolizing enzymes are provided to demonstrate the network technologies.},

Systems biology technologies, data and knowledge are particularly useful in understanding disease processes and drug actions. An important area of integration between systems biology and drug discovery is the concept of polypharmacology: the treatment of diseases by modulating more than one target. Polypharmacology for complex diseases is likely to involve multiple drugs acting on distinct targets that are part of a network regulating physiological responses. This review discusses the current state of the systems-level understanding of diseases and both the therapeutic and adverse mechanisms of drug actions. Drug-target networks can be used to identify multiple targets and to determine suitable combinations of drug targets or drugs.

These are considered potential new targets for drug discovery, and many companies have been focusing on ligand identification using high-throughput functional assays in the quest to discover a tool to further probe the pathophysiolgical role of these new receptors.

	Abstract = {Drug-induced QT interval prolongation has been identified as a critical side-effect of non-cardiovascular therapeutic agents and has resulted in the withdrawal of many drugs from the market. As almost all cases of drug-induced QT prolongation can be traced to the blockade of a voltage-dependent potassium ion channel encoded by the hERG (the human ether-{\`a}-go-go-related gene), early identification of potential hERG channel blockers will decrease the risk of cardiotoxicity-induced attritions in the later and more expensive development stage. Presented herein is a naive Bayes classifier to categorize hERG blockers into active and inactive classes, by using a universal, generic molecular descriptor system.1 The naive Bayes classifier was built from a training set containing 1979 corporate compounds, and exhibited an ROC accuracy of 0.87. The model was validated on an external test set of 66 drugs, of which 58 were correctly classified. The cumulative probabilities reflected the confidence of prediction and were proven useful for the identification of hERG blockers. Relative performance was compared for two classifiers constructed from either an atom-type-based molecular descriptor or the long range functional class fingerprint descriptor FCFP_6. The combination of an atom-typing descriptor and the naive Bayes classification technique enables the interpretation of the resulting model, which offers extra information for the design of compounds free of undesirable hERG activity.},

	Abstract = {Drug-induced QT interval prolongation is one of the most common reasons for the withdrawal of drugs from the market. In the past decade, at least nine drugs, i.e. terfenadine, astemizole, grepafloxacin, terodiline, droperidol, lidoflazine, sertindole, levomethadyl and cisapride, have been removed from the market or their use has been severely restricted because of drug-induced QT interval prolongation. Therefore, this irregularity is a major safety concern in the case of drugs submitted for regulatory approval. The most common mechanism of drug-induced QT interval prolongation may be drug-related inhibition of the human ether-{\'a}-go-go-related gene (hERG) channel, which subsequently results in prolongation of the cardiac action potential duration (APD). hERGAPDbase is a database of electrophysiological experimental data documenting potential hERG channel inhibitory actions and the APD-prolongation activities of chemical compounds. All data entries are manually collected from scientific papers and curated by a person.

Although PubChem contains a vast amount of compound and assay data, it currently does not have a convenient or efficient method to obtain in-depth promiscuity counts for compounds. PubChem Promiscuity fills this gap. It is a Java servlet that uses NCBI Entrez (eUtils) web services to interact with PubChem and provide promiscuity counts in a variety of categories along with compound descriptors, including PAINS based function group detection.

Full-text contextual searching functionality using Lucene allows the querying of name, synonym, definition, DOID and cross-reference (xrefs) with complex Boolean search strings. The DO semantically integrates disease and medical vocabularies through extensive cross mapping and integration of MeSH, ICD, NCI's thesaurus, SNOMED CT and OMIM disease-specific terms and identifiers. The DO is utilized for disease annotation by major biomedical databases (e.g. Array Express, CTD, NIF, IEDB), as a standard representation of human disease in biomedical ontologies (e.g. IDO, Cell line ontology, NIFSTD ontology, Experimental Factor Ontology, Influenza Ontology), and as an ontological cross mappings resource between DO, MeSH and OMIM (e.g. GeneWiki). The DO project (http://diseaseontology.sf.net) has been incorporated into open source tools (e.g. Gene Answers, FunDO) to connect gene and disease biomedical data through the lens of human disease. The next iteration of the DO web browser will integrate DO's extended relations and logical definition representation along with these biomedical resource cross-mappings.},

To facilitate the identification of such molecules, we developed a novel strategy making use of structural conservatism found in protein domain architecture and natural product inspired compound library design. Domains and proteins identified as being structurally similar in their ligand-sensing cores are grouped in a protein structure similarity cluster (PSSC). Natural products can be considered as evolutionary pre-validated ligands for multiple proteins and therefore natural products that are known to interact with one of the PSSC member proteins are selected as guiding structures for compound library synthesis. Application of this novel strategy for compound library design provided enhanced hit rates in small compound libraries for structurally similar proteins.},

Family classification is used for sensitive identification, consistent annotation, and detection of annotation errors. The superfamily curation defines signature domain architecture and categorizes memberships to improve automated classification. To increase the amount of experimental annotation, the PIR has developed a bibliography system for literature searching, mapping, and user submission, and has conducted retrospective attribution of citations for experimental features. PIR also maintains NREF, a non-redundant reference database, and iProClass, an integrated database of protein family, function, and structure information. PIR-NREF provides a timely and comprehensive collection of protein sequences, currently consisting of more than 1 000 000 entries from PIR-PSD, SWISS-PROT, TrEMBL, RefSeq, GenPept, and PDB. The PIR web site (http://pir.georgetown.edu) connects data analysis tools to underlying databases for information retrieval and knowledge discovery, with functionalities for interactive queries, combinations of sequence and text searches, and sorting and visual exploration of search results.

Michigan molecular interactions (MiMI) assists scientists searching through this profusion of molecular interaction data. The original release of MiMI gathered data from well-known protein interaction databases, and deep merged this information while keeping track of provenance. Based on the feedback received from users, MiMI has been completely redesigned. This article describes the resulting MiMI Release 2 (MiMIr2). New functionality includes extension from proteins to genes and to pathways; identification of highlighted sentences in source publications; seamless two-way linkage with Cytoscape; query facilities based on MeSH/GO terms and other concepts; approximate graph matching to find relevant pathways; support for querying in bulk; and a user focus-group driven interface design.

To create a network of interactions, STITCH aims to integrate the data dispersed over the literature and various databases of biological pathways, drug-target relationships and binding affinities. In STITCH 2, the number of relevant interactions is increased by incorporation of BindingDB, PharmGKB and the Comparative Toxicogenomics Database. The resulting network can be explored interactively or used as the basis for large-scale analyses. To facilitate links to other chemical databases, we adopt InChIKeys that allow identification of chemicals with a short, checksum-like string.

We have proposed a novel knowledge-based statistical approach, driven by the hidden structure-activity relationship (SAR) within a screening library, for primary hit selection. Application to an in-house ultrahigh-throughput screening (uHTS) campaign has demonstrated it can directly identify active scaffolds containing valuable SAR information with a greatly improved confirmation rate compared to the standard "top X" method (from 55\% to 85\%). This approach may help produce high-quality leads and expedite the hit-to-lead process in drug discovery.},

If HTS screening is carried out at the level of the intact organism, as is commonly done in crop protection, this strategy has the potential of uncovering a completely new mechanism of actions. The challenge in running a cost-effective HTS operation is to identify ways in which to improve the overall success rate in discovering new biologically active compounds. To this end, we describe our efforts directed at making full use of the data stream arising from HTS. This paper describes a comparative study in which several machine learning and chemometric methodologies were used to develop classifiers on the same data sets derived from in vivo HTS campaigns and their predictive performances compared in terms of false negative and false positive error profiles.},

	Abstract = {Fragment-based drug discovery (FBDD) is an important new tool to understand the molecule basis of ligand-biological target interactions. By combining optimal fragments, it is often possible to construct larger molecular weight compounds that have greater potency in a shorter period of time than can been achieved by the initial screening of larger molecular weight compound libraries. Alternatively, if screening of more traditional larger libraries has occurred, then it may be possible to analyze the data during the process of hit triage in such as way as to essentially adopt a fragment-based approach in reverse. In this review, we highlight general principles associated with the efficiency indices such as Ligand Efficiency (LE) in which screening data is normalized for biophysical properties such as molecular size. We further focus on the concept of Fit Quality (FQ), which standardizes LE values across molecular weight for more realistic, direct comparison. Using these simple concepts, one can apply FBDD routinely in the stage of hit triage when evaluating the data obtained after screening of compound libraries in drug discovery.},

	Abstract = {Presently, there are numerous bioinformatics databases available on different websites. Although RDF was proposed as a standard format for the web, these databases are still available in various formats. With the increasing popularity of the semantic web technologies and the ever growing number of databases in bioinformatics, there is a pressing need to develop mashup systems to help the process of bioinformatics knowledge integration. Bio2RDF is such a system, built from rdfizer programs written in JSP, the Sesame open source triplestore technology and an OWL ontology. With Bio2RDF, documents from public bioinformatics databases such as Kegg, PDB, MGI, HGNC and several of NCBI's databases can now be made available in RDF format through a unique URL in the form of http://bio2rdf.org/namespace:id. The Bio2RDF project has successfully applied the semantic web technology to publicly available databases by creating a knowledge space of RDF documents linked together with normalized URIs and sharing a common ontology. Bio2RDF is based on a three-step approach to build mashups of bioinformatics data. The present article details this new approach and illustrates the building of a mashup used to explore the implication of four transcription factor genes in Parkinson's disease. The Bio2RDF repository can be queried at http://bio2rdf.org.},

	Abstract = {In an effort to discover potent, clinically useful thrombin inhibitors, a rapid analogue synthetic approach was used to explore the P-1 region. Various benzylamines were coupled to a pyridine/pyrazinone P-2-P-3 template. One compound with an o-thiadiazole benzylic substitution was found to have a thrombin K-i of 0.84 nM. A study of ortho-substituted five-membered-ring heterocycles was undertaken and subsequently demonstrated that the o-triazole and tetrazole rings were optimal. Combination of these potent P-1 aryl heterocycles with a variety of P-2-P-3 groups produced a compound with an extraordinary thrombin inhibitory activity of 1.4 pM. It is hoped that this potency enhancement in P-1 will allow for more diversification in the P-2-P-3 region to ultimately address additional pharmacological concerns.},

	Abstract = {A computational methodology is introduced to systematically organize compound analogue series according to substitution sites and identify combinations of sites that determine structure-activity relationships (SARs) and make large contributions to SAR discontinuity. These sites are prime targets for further chemical modification. The approach involves the analysis of substitution patterns in "combinatorial analogue graphs" (CAG) and the application of an SAR analysis function to evaluate contributions of variable R-groups. It is applicable to analogue series spanning different potency ranges, for example, analogues taken from lead optimization programs or screening data sets (where potency differences might be subtle). In addition to determining key substitution patterns that cause significant SAR discontinuity, CAG analysis also identifies "SAR holes", i.e., nonexplored combinations of substitution sites, and SAR regions that are under-sampled in analogue series.},

	Abstract = {Discontinuity in structure-activity relationships (SARs) is caused by so-called activity cliffs and represents one of the major caveats in SAR modeling and lead optimization. At activity cliffs, small structural modifications of compounds lead to substantial differences in potency that are essentially'unpredictable using quantitative structure-activity relationship QSAR) methods. In order to better understand SAR discontinuity at the molecular level of detail, we have analyzed different compound series in combinatorial analog graphs and determined substitution patterns that introduce activity cliffs of varying magnitude. So identified SAR determinants were then analyzed on the basis of complex crystal structures to enable a structural interpretation of SAR discontinuity and underlying activity cliffs. In some instances, SAR discontinuity detected within analog series could be well rationalized on the basis of structural data, whereas in others a structural explanation was not possible. This'reflects the intrinsic complexity of small molecule SARs and suggests that the analysis of short-range receptor-ligand interactions seen in X-ray structures is insufficient to comprehensively a(;count for SAR discontinuity. However, in other cases, SAR information extracted from ligands was incomplete but could be deduced taking X-ray data into account. Thus, taken together, these findings illustrate the complementarity of ligand-based SAR analysis and structural information.},

	Abstract = {We introduce Single R-Group Polymorphisms (SRPs, pronounced 'sharps'), an intuitive framework for analyzing substituent effects and activity cliffs in a single congeneric series. A SRP is a pair of compounds that differ only in a single R-group position. Because the same substituent pair may occur in multiple SRPs in the series (i.e., with different combinations of substituents at the other R-group positions), SRP analysis makes it easy to identify systematic substituent effects and activity cliffs at each point of variation SRPs can be visualized as a symmetric heatmap where each cell represents a particular pair of substituents color-coded by the average difference in activity between the compounds that contain that particular SRP. SRP maps offer several advantages over existing techniques for visualizing activity cliffs: 1) the chemical structures of all the substituents are displayed simultaneously on a single map, thus directly engaging the pattern recognition abilities of the medicinal chemist; 2) it is based on R-group decomposition, a natural paradigm for generating and rationalizing SAR; 3) it uses a heatmap representation that makes it easy to identify systematic trends in the data; 4) it generalizes the concept of activity cliffs beyond similarity by allowing the analyst to sort the substituents according to any property of interest or place them manually in any desired order.},

	Abstract = {An activity landscape model of a compound data set can be rationalized as a graphical representation that integrates molecular similarity and potency relationships. Activity landscape representations of different design are utilized to aid in the analysis of structure activity relationships and the selection of informative compounds. Activity landscape models reported thus far focus on a single target (i.e., a single biological activity) or at most two targets, giving rise to selectivity landscapes. For compounds active against more than two targets, landscapes representing multitarget activities are difficult to conceptualize and have not yet been reported. Herein, we present a first activity landscape design that integrates compound potency relationships across multiple targets in a formally consistent manner. These multitarget activity landscapes are based on a general activity cliff classification scheme and are visualized in graph representations, where activity cliffs are represented as edges. Furthermore, the contributions of individual compounds to structure activity relationship discontinuity across multiple targets are monitored. The methodology has been applied to derive multitarget activity landscapes for compound data sets active against different target families. The resulting landscapes identify single-, dual-, and triple-target activity cliffs and reveal the presence of hierarchical cliff distributions. From these multitarget activity landscapes, compounds forming complex activity cliffs can be readily selected.},

	Abstract = {Consider a set S of n data points in real d-dimensional space, R-d, where distances are measured using any Minkowski metric. In nearest neighbor searching, we preprocess S into a data structure, so that given any query point q epsilon R-d, is the closest point of S to q can be reported quickly. Given any positive real epsilon, a data point p is a (1 + epsilon)-approximate nearest neighbor of q if its distance from q is within a factor of (1 + epsilon) Of the distance to the true nearest neighbor. We show that it is possible to preprocess a set of n points in R-d in O(dn log n) time and O(dn) space, so that given a query point q epsilon R-d, and epsilon > 0, a (1 + epsilon)-approximate nearest neighbor of q can be computed in O(c(d,epsilon) log n) time, where c(d,epsilon) less than or equal to d [1 + 6d/epsilon](d) is a factor depending only on dimension and epsilon. In general, we show that given an integer k greater than or equal to 1 (1 + epsilon)-approximations to the k nearest neighbors of q cart be computed in additional O(kd log n) time.},

@article{Hu:2010kl,
	Abstract = {In target-dependent activity landscapes of compound series, cliffs are formed by pairs of molecules that are structurally analogous but display significant differences in potency. The detection and analysis of such activity cliffs is a major task in structure-activity relationship analysis and compound optimization. In analogy to activity cliffs, selectivity cliffs can be defined that are formed by structural analogs having significantly different potencies against two targets. The formation of activity cliffs by analogs is generally a consequence of different R-group patterns; e.g., a specific substitution of a given scaffold might increase and another substitution decrease potency. Therefore, activity (or selectivity) cliffs are typically analyzed for a given scaffold representing an analog series, and it has thus far not been explored whether certain scaffolds might display a general tendency to yield compounds forming activity cliffs against different targets. We have exhaustively analyzed scaffolds and associated compound activity data in the ChemblDB and BindingDB databases in order to compare the availability of target-selective scaffolds in these databases and determine whether multi-target activity and multi-target selectivity cliff scaffolds exist. Perhaps unexpectedly, we have identified 143 scaffolds that are represented by multiple compounds and form activity or selectivity cliffs against different targets. These scaffolds have varying chemical complexities and are in part promiscuous binders (i.e., compounds containing these scaffolds bind to distantly related or unrelated targets). However, analogs derived from these scaffolds form steep activity cliffs against different targets. A catalog of scaffolds with high propensity to form activity or selectivity cliffs against multiple targets is provided to help identify potentially promiscuous candidate scaffolds during compound optimization efforts.},

@article{Peltason:2010dz,
	Abstract = {Activity landscapes are defined by potency and similarity distributions of active compounds and reflect the nature of structure-activity relationships (SARs). Three-dimensional (3D) activity landscapes are reminiscent of topographical maps and particularly intuitive representations of compound similarity and potency distributions. From their topologies, SAR characteristics can be deduced. Accordingly, idealized theoretical landscape models have been utilized to rationalize SAR features, but "true" 3D activity landscapes have not yet been described in detail. Herein we present a computational approach to derive approximate 3D activity landscapes for actual compound data sets and to analyze exemplary landscape representations. These activity landscapes are generated within a consistent reference frame so that they can be compared across different activity classes. We show that SAR features of compound data sets can be derived from the topology of landscape models. A notable correlation is observed between global SAR phenotypes, assigned on the basis of SAR discontinuity scoring, and characteristic landscape topologies. We also show that different molecular representations can substantially alter the topology of activity landscapes for a given data set and modulate the formation of activity cliffs, which represent the most prominent landscape features. Depending on the choice of molecular representations, compounds forming a steep activity cliff in a given landscape might be separated in another and no longer form a cliff. However, comparison of alternative activity landscapes makes it possible to focus on compound subsets having high SAR information content.},

@article{Wawer:2010fv,
	Abstract = {An intuitive and generally applicable analysis method, termed similarity-potency tree (SPT), is introduced to mine structure-activity relationship (SAR) information in compound data sets of any source. Only compound potency values and nearest-neighbor similarity relationships are considered. Rather than analyzing a data set as a whole, in part overlapping compound neighborhoods are systematically generated and represented as SPTs. This local analysis scheme simplifies the evaluation of SAR information and SPTs of high SAR information content are easily identified. By inspecting only a limited number of compound neighborhoods, it is also straightforward to determine whether data sets contain only little or no interpretable SAR information. Interactive analysis of SPTs is facilitated by reading the trees in two directions, which makes it possible to extract SAR rules, if available, in a consistent manner. The simplicity and interpretability of the data structure and the ease of calculation are characteristic features of this approach. We apply the methodology to high-throughput screening and lead optimization data sets, compare the approach to standard clustering techniques, illustrate how SAR rules are derived, and provide some practical guidance how to best utilize the methodology. The SPT program is made freely available to the scientific community.},

	Abstract = {The extraction of SAR information from structurally diverse compound data sets is a challenging task. One of the focal points of systematic SAR analysis is the search for activity cliffs, that is, structurally similar compounds having large potency differences, from which SAR determinants can be deduced. The assessment of SAR information is usually based on pairwise similarity and potency comparisons of data set compounds. As a consequence, activity cliffs are mostly evaluated at a compound pair level. Here, we present an extension of the activity cliff concept by introducing "activity ridges" that are formed by overlapping "combinatorial" activity cliffs between participating compounds, giving rise to ridge-like structures in activity landscapes. Activity ridges are rich in SAR information. In a systematic analysis of 242 compound data sets, we have identified well-defined activity ridges in 71 different sets. In addition, an information-theoretic approach has been devised to characterize the structural composition of activity ridges. Taken together, our results show that activity ridges frequently occur in sets of active compounds and that different categories of ridges can be distinguished on the basis of their structural content. The computational identification of activity ridges provides access to compound subsets having high priority for SAR analysis.},

In order to compare ligands that are active against a given receptor but have different mechanisms of action, we have designed molecular networks that mirror similarity relationships and incorporate both mechanism of action information and mechanism-specific SAR features. These network representations make it possible to systematically evaluate relationships between different types of receptor ligands and identify communities of structurally very similar ligands with different mechanisms. From a series of such ligands, structural modifications can often be deduced that lead to "mechanism hops".},

	Abstract = {Pharmaceutical companies routinely collect data across multiple projects for common ADME endpoints. Although at the time of collection the data is intended for use in decision making within a specific project, knowledge can be gained by data mining the entire cross-project data set for patterns of structure-activity relationships (SAR) that may be applied to any project. One such data mining method is pairwise analysis. This method has the advantage of being able to identify small structural changes that lead to significant changes in activity. In this paper, we describe the process for full pairwise analysis of our high-throughput ADME assays routinely used for compound discovery efforts at Pfizer (microsomal clearance, passive membrane permeability, P-gp efflux, and lipophilicity). We also describe multiple strategies for the application of these transforms in a prospective manner during compound design. Finally, a detailed analysis of the activity patterns in pairs of compounds that share the same molecular transformation reveals multiple types of transforms from an SAR perspective. These include bioisosteres, additives, multiplicatives, and a type we call switches as they act to either turn on or turn off an activity.},

These property differences were associated with the chemical transformations encoded in the SMIRKS reaction notation. The transformations identified a subseries with the optimal balance of these two parameters. Enumeration of a virtual library of compounds using the extracted transformations identified two additional compounds initially excluded from the analysis with an accurate estimation of their biological activity.

	Abstract = {Applying the concept of matched molecular pairs, we have systematically analyzed the ability of defined chemical changes to introduce activity cliffs. Public domain compound data were systematically screened for matched molecular pairs that were then organized according to chemical transformations they represent and associated potency changes. From vast available chemical transformation space, including both R-group and core substructure changes, approximately 250 nonredundant substitutions were identified that displayed a general tendency to form activity cliffs. These substitutions introduced activity cliffs in the structural context of diverse scaffolds and in compounds active against many different targets. Activity cliff-forming transformations were often rather simple, including replacements of small functional groups. Moreover, in many instances, chemically very similar transformations were identified that had a much lower propensity to form activity cliffs or no detectable cliff potential. Thus, clear preferences emerged for specific transformations. A compendium of substitutions with general activity cliff-forming potential is provided to aid in compound optimization efforts.},

It is observed that the potency changes induced by most chemical groups follows a nearly normal distribution centered near zero (i.e., no effect on potency). However, the widths of the distributions vary significantly between different substituents, and these effects cannot be rationalized by simple physicochemical parameters. In addition, certain substituents consistently bias the distribution toward higher or lower potency, suggesting the existence of preferred and nonpreferred chemical groups for lead optimization. The implications of these results for understanding protein-ligand recognition and for enhancing the efficiency and speed of lead optimization will be discussed.},

We suggest two ways of representing a transformation in silico, as a substructure descriptor difference vector, and as the set of atoms remaining once a maximum common substructure is eliminated. Such transformations can be filtered sensibly, and it is easy to compare one transformation to another. These representations have two applications. First, we can use these methods to automatically organize and display sets of closely related compounds such that any consistent local QSAR in a data set can be easily seen, the T-ANALYZE application. Second, we can suggest to a chemist how to change a molecule "on hand" to a more active one based on local QSAR for that activity, the T-MORPH application.},

	Abstract = {Malaria is a devastating infection caused by protozoa of the genus Plasmodium. Drug resistance is widespread, no new chemical class of antimalarials has been introduced into clinical practice since 1996 and there is a recent rise of parasite strains with reduced sensitivity to the newest drugs. We screened nearly 2 million compounds in GlaxoSmithKline's chemical library for inhibitors of P. falciparum, of which 13,533 were confirmed to inhibit parasite growth by at least 80\% at 2 microM concentration. More than 8,000 also showed potent activity against the multidrug resistant strain Dd2. Most (82\%) compounds originate from internal company projects and are new to the malaria community. Analyses using historic assay data suggest several novel mechanisms of antimalarial action, such as inhibition of protein kinases and host-pathogen interaction related targets. Chemical structures and associated data are hereby made public to encourage additional drug lead identification efforts and further research into this disease.},

	Abstract = {We report consensus Structure-Activity Similarity (SAS) maps that address the dependence of activity landscapes on molecular representation. As a case study, we characterized the activity landscape of 54 compounds with activities against human cathepsin B (hCatB), human cathepsin L (hCatL), and Trypanosoma brucei cathepsin B (TbCatB). Starting from an initial set of 28 descriptors we selected ten representations that capture different aspects of the chemical structures. These included four 2D (MACCS keys, GpiDAPH3, pairwise, and radial fingerprints) and six 3D (4p and piDAPH4 fingerprints with each including three conformers) representations. Multiple conformers are used for the first time in consensus activity landscape modeling. The results emphasize the feasibility of identifying consensus data points that are consistently formed in different reference spaces generated with several fingerprint models, including multiple 3D conformers. Consensus data points are not meant to eliminate data, disregarding, for example, "true" activity cliffs that are not identified by some molecular representations. Instead, consensus models are designed to prioritize the SAR analysis of activity cliffs and other consistent regions in the activity landscape that are captured by several molecular representations. Systematic description of the SARs of two targets give rise to the identification of pairs of compounds located in the same region of the activity landscape of hCatL and TbCatB suggesting similar mechanisms of action for the pairs involved. We also explored the relationship between property similarity and activity similarity and found that property similarities are suitable to characterize SARs. We also introduce the concept of structure-property-activity (SPA) similarity in SAR studies.},

	Abstract = {New diphenolic azoles as highly selective estrogen receptor-beta agonists are reported. The more potent and selective analogues of these series have comparable binding affinities for ERbeta as the natural ligand 17beta-estradiol but are >100-fold selective over ERalpha. Our design strategy not only followed a traditional SAR approach but also was supported by X-ray structures of ERbeta cocrystallized with various ligands as well as molecular modeling studies. These strategies enabled us to take advantage of a single conservative residue substitution in the ligand-binding pocket, ERalpha Met(421) --> ERbeta Ile(373), to optimize ERbeta selectivity. The 7-position-substituted benzoxazoles (Table 5) were the most selective ligands of both azole series, with ERB-041 (117) being >200-fold selective for ERbeta. The majority of ERbeta selective agonists tested that were at least approximately 50-fold selective displayed a consistent in vivo profile: they were inactive in several models of classic estrogen action (uterotrophic, osteopenia, and vasomotor instability models) and yet were active in the HLA-B27 transgenic rat model of inflammatory bowel disease. These data suggest that ERbeta-selective agonists are devoid of classic estrogenic effects and may offer a novel therapy to treat certain inflammatory conditions.},

	Abstract = {This paper presents a theoretical model of how data fusion can be used to combine the results of multiple similarity searches of chemical databases. The model is based on frequency distributions of similarity values that are fused using a multiple integration over regions defined by the particular fusion rule that is being applied. For pairwise fusion, the resulting double integrals are straightforward to evaluate for simple model distributions. Similarity values for recovered-active and recovered-nonactive frequency distributions are independently modeled using a constant background, linearly biased terms, and a first-order correlated term. The model shows that two standard fusion rules can give performance enhancements in some cases but that the results of fusion are dependent on many factors that, taken together, can lead to seemingly inconsistent levels of enhancement.},

	Abstract = {In a recent companion paper we have related the operation of simple data fusion rules used in virtual screening to a multiple integral formalism. In this paper we extend these ideas to the analysis of data fusion methods applied to real data. We examine several cases of similarity fusion using different coefficients and different representations and consider the reasons for positive or negative results in terms of the similarity distributions. Results are obtained using the SUM-, MAX- MIN-, and CombMNZ-fusion rules. We also develop a customized fusion rule, which provides an estimate of the optimal possible result for fusing multiple searches of a specific database; this shows that similarity fusion can, in principle, achieve retrieval enhancements even if this is not achieved in practice with current fusion rules. The methods are extended to analyze the comparatively successful results of group fusion with multiple actives, and we provide a rationale for the observed superiority of the MAX-rule over the SUM-rule in this context.},

	Abstract = {The role of activity cliffs in drug discovery projects is certainly two-edged: on the one hand, they often lead to the failure of QSAR modeling techniques; on the other, they are highly valuable for identifying key aspects of SARs. In the presence of activity cliffs the results of purely ligand-based QSAR approaches often remain puzzling, and the resulting models have limited predictive power. Herein we present a new approach for the identification of structure-based activity cliffs (ISAC). It uses the valuable information of activity cliffs in a structure-based design scenario by analyzing interaction energies of protein-ligand complexes. Using the relative frequency at which a protein atom is involved in activity cliff events, we introduce a novel visualization of hot spots in the active site of a protein. The ISAC approach supports the medicinal chemist in elucidating the key interacting atoms of the binding site and facilitates the development of pharmacophore hypotheses. The hot spot visualization can be applied to small data sets in early project phases as well as in the lead optimization process. Based on the ISAC approach, we developed a method to derive target-specific scoring functions and pharmacophore constraints, which were validated on independent external data sets in virtual screening experiments. The activity-cliff-based approach shows an improved enrichment over the generic empirical scoring function for various protein targets in the validation set.},

	Abstract = {In an effort to develop strategies that improve the efficacy of existing anticancer agents, we have conducted a siRNA-based RNAi screen to identify genes that, when targeted by siRNA, improve the activity of the topoisomerase I (Top1) poison camptothecin (CPT). Screening was conducted using a set of siRNAs corresponding to over 400 apoptosis-related genes in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. During the course of these studies, we identified the silencing of MAP3K7 as a significant enhancer of CPT activity. Follow-up analysis of caspase activity and caspase-dependent phosphorylation of histone H2AX demonstrated that the silencing of MAP3K7 enhanced CPT-associated apoptosis. Silencing MAP3K7 also sensitized cells to additional compounds, including CPT clinical analogs. This activity was not restricted to MDA-MB-231 cells, as the silencing of MAP3K7 also sensitized the breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-468 and HCT-116 colon cancer cells. However, MAP3K7 silencing did not affect compound activity in the comparatively normal mammary epithelial cell line MCF10A, as well as some additional tumorigenic lines. MAP3K7 encodes the TAK1 kinase, an enzyme that is central to the regulation of many processes associated with the growth of cancer cells (e.g. NF-kB, JNK, and p38 signaling). An analysis of TAK1 signaling pathway members revealed that the silencing of TAB2 also sensitizes MDA-MB-231 and HCT-116 cells towards CPT. These findings may offer avenues towards lowering the effective doses of Top1 inhibitors in cancer cells and, in doing so, broaden their application.},

Chromosomal loci associated with 49 DCPs were confirmed by linkage analysis and tests of genetically modified parasites, including three genes that were linked to 96\% of the DCPs.

	Abstract = {Activity landscape characterization has been demonstrated to be a valuable tool in lead optimization, virtual screening, and computational modeling of active compounds. In this work, we present a general protocol to explore systematically the activity landscape of a lead series using 11 2D and 3D structural representations. As a test case we employed a set of 48 bicyclic guanidines (BCGs) with kappa-opioid receptor binding affinity, identified in our group. MACCS keys, graph-based three point pharmacophores, circular fingerprints, ROCS shape descriptors, and the TARIS approach, that compares structures based on molecular electrostatic potentials, were employed as orthogonal descriptors. Based on 'activity cliffs' common to a series of descriptors, we introduce the concept of consensus activity cliffs. Results for the current test case suggest that the presence or absence of a methoxybenzyl group may lead to different modes of binding for the active BCGs with the kappa-opioid receptor. The most active compound (IC50 = 37 nM) is involved in a number of consensus cliffs making it a more challenge query for future virtual screening than would be expected from affinity alone. Results also reveal the importance of screening high density combinatorial libraries, especially in the "cliff-rich" regions of activity landscapes. The protocol presented here can be applied to other data sets to develop a consensus model of the activity landscape.},

Analyses of the data based upon physical and calculated properties of each individual molecule were performed and resulting trends were considered in the context of commonly held opinions of how physicochemical properties influence aqueous solubility. We further analyze the data using a decision tree model for solubility prediction and via a multi-dimensional assessment of physicochemical relationships to solubility in the context of specific 'rule-breakers' relative to common dogma. The role of solubility as a determinant of assay outcome is also considered based upon each compound's cross-assay activity score for a collection of publicly available screening results. Further, the role of solubility as a governing factor for colloidal aggregation formation within a specified assay setting is examined and considered as a possible cause of a high cross-assay activity score. The results of this solubility profile should aid chemists during library design and optimization efforts and represent a useful training set for computational solubility prediction.},

In a collaborative effort, the NIH Chemical Genomics Center determined IC(50)'s for Plasmodium falciparum viability for each of 2,070 members of the CMLD-BU compound collection using quantitative high-throughput screening across five parasite lines of distinct geographic origin. Three compound classes displaying either differential or comprehensive antimalarial activity across the lines were identified, and the nascent structure activity relationships (SAR) from this experiment used to initiate optimization of these chemotypes for further development.},

Much effort has been made to evaluate and validate the statistical modeling in QSAR, but these analyses treat the dataset as fixed. An overlooked but highly important issue is the validation of the setup of the dataset, which comprises addition of chemical structures as well as selection of descriptors and software implementations prior to calculations. This process is hampered by the lack of standards and exchange formats in the field, making it virtually impossible to reproduce and validate analyses and drastically constrain collaborations and re-use of data.},

@article{Ghosh:2010uq,
	Abstract = {The West Nile virus (WNV) is an infectious disease spreading rapidly throughout the United States, causing illness among thousands of birds, animals, and humans. Yet, we only have a rudimentary understanding of how the mosquito-borne virus operates in complex avian--human environmental systems coupled with risk factors. The large array of multidimensional risk factors underlying WNV incidences is environmental, built-environment, socioeconomic, and existing mosquito abatement policies. Therefore it is essential to identify an optimal number of risk factors whose management would result in effective disease prevention and containment. Previous models built to select important risk factors assumed a priori that there is a linear relationship between these risk factors and disease incidences. However, it is difficult for linear models to incorporate the complexity of the WNV transmission network and hence identify an optimal number of risk factors objectively.
There are two objectives of this paper, first, use combination of genetic algorithm (GA) and computational neural network (CNN) approaches to build a model incorporating the non-linearity between incidences and hypothesized risk factors. Here GA is used for risk factor (variable) selection and CNN for model building mainly because of their ability to capture complex relationships with higher accuracy than linear models. The second objective is to propose a method to measure the relative importance of the selected risk factors included in the model. The study is situated in the metropolitan area of Minnesota, which had experienced significant outbreaks from 2002 till present.

	Abstract = {Modern drug discovery organizations generate large volumes of SAR data. A promising methodology that can be used to mine this chemical data to identify novel structure−activity relationships is the matched molecular pair (MMP) methodology. However, before the full potential of the MMP methodology can be utilized, a MMP identification method that is capable of identifying all MMPs in large chemical data sets on modest computational hardware is required. In this paper we report an algorithm that is capable of systematically generating all MMPs in chemical data sets. Additionally, the algorithm is computationally efficient enough to be applied on large data sets. As an example the algorithm was used to identify the MMPs in the 300k NIH MLSMR set. The algorithm identified 5.3 million matched molecular pairs in the set. These pairs cover 2.6 million unique molecular transformations.},

	Abstract = {Current work in elucidating relationships between diseases has largely been based on pre-existing knowledge of disease genes. Consequently, these studies are limited in their discovery of new and unknown disease relationships. We present the first quantitative framework to compare and contrast diseases by an integrated analysis of disease-related mRNA expression data and the human protein interaction network. We identified 4,620 functional modules in the human protein network and provided a quantitative metric to record their responses in 54 diseases leading to 138 significant similarities between diseases. Fourteen of the significant disease correlations also shared common drugs, supporting the hypothesis that similar diseases can be treated by the same drugs, allowing us to make predictions for new uses of existing drugs. Finally, we also identified 59 modules that were dysregulated in at least half of the diseases, representing a common disease-state ``signature''. These modules were significantly enriched for genes that are known to be drug targets. Interestingly, drugs known to target these genes/proteins are already known to treat significantly more diseases than drugs targeting other genes/proteins, highlighting the importance of these core modules as prime therapeutic opportunities.},

	Abstract = {The molecular understanding of phenotypes caused by drugs in humans is essential for elucidating mechanisms of action and for developing personalized medicines. Side effects of drugs (also known as adverse drug reactions) are an important source of human phenotypic information, but so far research on this topic has been hampered by insufficient accessibility of data. Consequently, we have developed a public, computer-readable side effect resource (SIDER) that connects 888 drugs to 1450 side effect terms. It contains information on frequency in patients for one-third of the drug-side effect pairs. For 199 drugs, the side effect frequency of placebo administration could also be extracted. We illustrate the potential of SIDER with a number of analyses. The resource is freely available for academic research at http://sideeffects.embl.de.},

	Abstract = {More complete knowledge of the molecular mechanisms underlying cancer will improve prevention, diagnosis and treatment. Efforts such as The Cancer Genome Atlas are systematically characterizing the structural basis of cancer, by identifying the genomic mutations associated with each cancer type. A powerful complementary approach is to systematically characterize the functional basis of cancer, by identifying the genes essential for growth and related phenotypes in different cancer cells. Such information would be particularly valuable for identifying potential drug targets. Here, we report the development of an efficient, robust approach to perform genome-scale pooled shRNA screens for both positive and negative selection and its application to systematically identify cell essential genes in 12 cancer cell lines. By integrating these functional data with comprehensive genetic analyses of primary human tumors, we identified known and putative oncogenes such as EGFR, KRAS, MYC, BCR-ABL, MYB, CRKL, and CDK4 that are essential for cancer cell proliferation and also altered in human cancers. We further used this approach to identify genes involved in the response of cancer cells to tumoricidal agents and found 4 genes required for the response of CML cells to imatinib treatment: PTPN1, NF1, SMARCB1, and SMARCE1, and 5 regulators of the response to FAS activation, FAS, FADD, CASP8, ARID1A and CBX1. Broad application of this highly parallel genetic screening strategy will not only facilitate the rapid identification of genes that drive the malignant state and its response to therapeutics but will also enable the discovery of genes that participate in any biological process.},

	Abstract = {Although genomewide RNA expression analysis has become a routine tool in biomedical research, extracting biological insight from such information remains a major challenge. Here, we describe a powerful analytical method called Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) for interpreting gene expression data. The method derives its power by focusing on gene sets, that is, groups of genes that share common biological function, chromosomal location, or regulation. We demonstrate how GSEA yields insights into several cancer-related data sets, including leukemia and lung cancer. Notably, where single-gene analysis finds little similarity between two independent studies of patient survival in lung cancer, GSEA reveals many biological pathways in common. The GSEA method is embodied in a freely available software package, together with an initial database of 1,325 biologically defined gene sets.},

@article{Zhao:2009hs,
	Abstract = {Background: Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve is widely used to evaluate virtual screening (VS) studies. However, the method fails to address the "early recognition" problem specific to VS. Although many other metrics, such as RIE, BEDROC, and pROC that emphasize "early recognition" have been proposed, there are no rigorous statistical guidelines for determining the thresholds and performing significance tests. Also no comparisons have been made between these metrics under a statistical framework to better understand their performances.

Results: We have proposed a statistical framework to evaluate VS studies by which the threshold to determine whether a ranking method is better than random ranking can be derived by bootstrap simulations and 2 ranking methods can be compared by permutation test. We found that different metrics emphasize "early recognition" differently. BEDROC and RIE are 2 statistically equivalent metrics. Our newly proposed metric SLR is superior to pROC. Through extensive simulations, we observed a "seesaw effect"-overemphasizing early recognition reduces the statistical power of a metric to detect true early recognitions.

Conclusion: The statistical framework developed and tested by us is applicable to any other metric as well, even if their exact distribution is unknown. Under this framework, a threshold can be easily selected according to a pre-specified type I error rate and statistical comparisons between 2 ranking methods becomes possible. The theoretical null distribution of SLR metric is available so that the threshold of SLR can be exactly determined without resorting to bootstrap simulations, which makes it easy to use in practical virtual screening studies.},

	Abstract = {Signaling by the transcription factor nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB) involves its release from inhibitor kappa B (IkappaB) in the cytosol, followed by translocation into the nucleus. NF-kappaB regulation Of IkappaBalpha transcription represents a delayed negative feedback loop that drives oscillations in NF-kappaB translocation. Single-cell time-lapse imaging band computational modeling of NF-kappaB (RelA) localization showed asynchronous oscillations following cell stimulation that decreased in frequency with increased IkappaBalpha transcription. Transcription of target genes depended on oscillation persistence, involving cycles of RelA phosphorytation and dephosphorylation. The functional consequences of NF-kappaB signaling may thus depend on number, period, and amplitude of oscillations.},

	Abstract = {Background: High content live cell imaging experiments are able to track the cellular localisation of labelled proteins in multiple live cells over a time course. Experiments using high content live cell imaging will generate multiple large datasets that are often stored in an ad-hoc manner. This hinders identification of previously gathered data that may be relevant to current analyses. Whilst solutions exist for managing image data, they are primarily concerned with storage and retrieval of the images themselves and not the data derived from the images. There is therefore a requirement for an information management solution that facilitates the indexing of experimental metadata and results of high content live cell imaging experiments.

Results: We have designed and implemented a data model and information management solution for the data gathered through high content live cell imaging experiments. Many of the experiments to be stored measure the translocation of fluorescently labelled proteins from cytoplasm to nucleus in individual cells. The functionality of this database has been enhanced by the addition of an algorithm that automatically annotates results of these experiments with the timings of translocations and periods of any oscillatory translocations as they are uploaded to the repository. Testing has shown the algorithm to perform well with a variety of previously unseen data.

Conclusion: Our repository is a fully functional example of how high throughput imaging data may be effectively indexed and managed to address the requirements of end users. By implementing the automated analysis of experimental results, we have provided a clear impetus for individuals to ensure that their data forms part of that which is stored in the repository. Although focused on imaging, the solution provided is sufficiently generic to be applied to other functional proteomics and genomics experiments. The software is available from: fhttp://code.google.com/p/livecellim/},

	Abstract = {Liver X receptors (LXR) are nuclear hormone receptors that play a critical role in cholesterol homeostasis. They regulate the expression of the ABCA1 gene, which mediates the efflux of cholesterol out of cells. LXR agonists are expected to increase cholesterol efflux, lower LDL, and raise HDL levels. Screening of a natural product library of microbial extracts using a LXR-SPA binding assay and bioassay-guided fractionation of an active extract of a Streptomyces sp. (MA6657) led to the discovery of two new hexacyclic aromatic ketones, (-)-anthrabenzoxocinone [(-)-ABX (1)], an enantiomer of BE-24566B, and (-)-bischloroanthrabenzoxocinone [(-)-BABX (2)]. The IC50 values of LXRalpha-SPA binding are 2 microM for (-)-ABX and 10 microM for (-)-BABX. This extract was also found to inhibit type II fatty acid synthesis, and its active component, (-)-BABX, was responsible for the majority of the inhibition. All three compounds showed good Gram-positive antibacterial activity (MIC 0.5-2 microg/mL). Details of the isolation, structure elucidation, LXR ligand binding, antibacterial activity, and selectivity of inhibition of 1 and 2 are described.},

	Abstract = {Measuring the (dis)similarity of molecules is important for many cheminformatics applications like compound ranking, clustering, and property prediction. In this work, we focus on real-valued vector representations of molecules (as opposed to the binary spaces of fingerprints). We demonstrate the influence which the choice of (dis)similarity measure can have on results, and provide recommendations for such choices. We review the mathematical concepts used to measure (dis)similarity in vector spaces, namely norms, metrics, inner products, and, similarity coefficients, as well as the relationships between them, employing (dis)similarity measures commonly used in cheminformatics as examples. We present several phenomena (empty space phenomenon, sphere volume related phenomena, distance concentration) in high-dimensional descriptor spaces which are not encountered in two and three dimensions. These phenomena are theoretically characterized and illustrated on both artificial and real (bioactivity)},

@article{Chen:2009hb,
	Abstract = {  Polypharmacology provides a new way to address the issue of high
  attrition rates arising from lack of efficacy and toxicity. However,
  the development of polypharmacology is hampered by the incomplete
  SAR data and limited resources for validating target
  combinations. The PubChem bioassay collection, reporting the activity of
  compounds in multiple assays, allows us to study polypharmacological
  behavior in the PubChem collection via cross-assay analysis. In this
  paper, we developed a network representation of the assay collection
  and then applied a bipartite mapping between this network and
  various biological networks (i.e., PPI, pathway) as well as
  artificial networks (i.e., drug-target network). Mapping to a
  drug-target network allows us to prioritize new selective
  compounds, while mapping to other biological networks enable us to
  observe interesting target pairs and their associated compounds
  in the context of biological systems.  Our results indicate this
  approach could be a useful way to investigate polypharmacology in
  the PubChem bioassay collection.

	Abstract = {We study an evolutionary model of a complex system that evolves under catalytic dynamics and Darwinian selection and exhibits spontaneous growth, stasis and then a collapse of its structure. We find that the typical lifetime of the system increases sharply with the diversity of its components or species. We also find that the prime reason for crashes is a naturally occurring internal fragility of the system. This fragility is captured in the network organizational character and is related to a reduced multiplicity of pathways or feedback loops between its components. These results apply to several generalizations of the model as well. This work suggests new parameters for understanding the robustness of evolving molecular networks, ecosystems, societies and markets.},

	Abstract = {The subject of this paper is to present molecular descriptors representing the electronegativity of OMO (occupied molecular orbital) and UMO (unoccupied molecular orbital) quantum molecular states that could be used to obtain information on the mechanism of electron transfer between metal compound and biological receptor. The molecular descriptors that were used suggested that the (s,p) and (dN) metal ions have different mechanisms of interaction with the receptor. This result explains why the correlation activity-descriptor is rather poor or practically does not exist when all metal ions are analyzed together (irrespective of their valence shell). Since this interaction is the last event of the long chain of processes of the metal ion up to the biological target, such molecular descriptors could be used together with other descriptors in QSAR models for prediction of biological activity.},

@article{Potapov:2008vy,
	Abstract = {Background: Currently, there is a gap between purely theoretical studies of the topology of large bioregulatory networks and the practical traditions and interests of experimentalists. While the theoretical approaches emphasize the global characterization of regulatory systems, the practical approaches focus on the role of distinct molecules and genes in regulation. To bridge the gap between these opposite approaches, one needs to combine 'general' with 'particular' properties and translate abstract topological features of large systems into testable functional characteristics of individual components. Here, we propose a new topological parameter - the pairwise disconnectivity index of a network's element - that is capable of such bridging.

Results: The pairwise disconnectivity index quantifies how crucial an individual element is for sustaining the communication ability between connected pairs of vertices in a network that is displayed as a directed graph. Such an element might be a vertex (i.e., molecules, genes), an edge (i.e., reactions, interactions), as well as a group of vertices and/or edges. The index can be viewed as a measure of topological redundancy of regulatory paths which connect different parts of a given network and as a measure of sensitivity (robustness) of this network to the presence (absence) of each individual element. Accordingly, we introduce the notion of a path-degree of a vertex in terms of its corresponding incoming, outgoing and mediated paths, respectively. The pairwise disconnectivity index has been applied to the analysis of several regulatory networks from various organisms. The importance of an individual vertex or edge for the coherence of the network is determined by the particular position of the given element in the whole network.

Conclusion: Our approach enables to evaluate the effect of removing each element (i.e., vertex, edge, or their combinations) from a network. The greatest potential value of this approach is its ability to systematically analyze the role of every element, as well as groups of elements, in a regulatory network.},

@article{Lemmen:2000yw,
	Abstract = {In drug design, often enough, no structural information on a particular receptor protein is available. However, frequently a considerable number of different ligands is known together with their measured binding affinities towards a receptor under consideration. In such a situation, a set of plausible relative superpositions of different ligands, hopefully approximating their putative binding geometry, is usually the method of choice for preparing data for the subsequent application of 3D methods that analyze the similarity or diversity of the ligands. Examples are 3D-QSAR studies, pharmacophore elucidation, and receptor modeling. An aggravating fact is that ligands are usually quite flexible and a rigorous analysis has to incorporate molecular flexibility. We review the past six years of scientific publishing on molecular superposition. Our focus lies on automatic procedures to be performed on arbitrary molecular structures. Methodical aspects are our main concern here. Accordingly, plain application studies with few methodical elements are omitted in this presentation. While this review cannot mention every contribution to this actively developing field, we intend to provide pointers to the recent literature providing important contributions to computational methods for the structural alignment of molecules. Finally we provide a perspective on how superposition methods can effectively be used for the purpose of virtual database screening. In our opinion it is the ultimate goal to detect analogues in structure databases of nontrivial size in order to narrow down the search space for subsequent experiments.},

	Abstract = {Self-organizing molecular field analysis (SOMFA) is a novel technique for three-dimensional quantitative structure-activity relations (3D-QSAR). It is simple and intuitive in concept and avoids the complex statistical tools and variable selection procedures favored by other methods. Our calculations show the method to be as predictive as the best 3D-QSAR methods available. Importantly, steric and electrostatic maps can be produced to aid the molecular design process by highlighting important molecular features. The simplicity of the technique leaves scope for further development, particularly with regard to handling molecular alignment and conformation selection. Here, the method has been used to predict the corticosteroid-binding globulin binding affinity of the "benchmark" steroids, expanded from the usual 31 compounds to 43 compounds. Test predictions have also been performed on a set of sulfonamide endothelin inhibitors.},

	Abstract = {A widely used way to compare the structures of biomolecules or solid bodies is to translate and rotate one structure with respect to the other to minimize the root-mean-square deviation (RMSD). We present a simple derivation, based on quaternions, for the optimal solid body transformation (rotation-translation) that minimizes the RMSD between two sets of vectors. We prove that the quaternion method is equivalent to the well-known formula due to Kabsch. We analyze the various cases that may arise, and give a complete enumeration of the special cases in terms of the arrangement of the eigenvalues of a traceless, 4 X 4 symmetric matrix. A key result here is an expression for the gradient of the RMSD as a function of model parameters. This can be useful, for example, in finding the minimum energy path of a reaction using the elastic band methods or in optimizing model parameters to best fit a target structure.

	Abstract = {It is often impractical to synthesize and test all compounds in a large exhaustive chemical library. Herein, we discuss rational approaches to selecting representative subsets of virtual libraries that help direct experimental synthetic efforts for diverse library design. We compare the performance of two stochastic sampling algorithms, Simulating Annealing Guided Evaluation (SAGE; Zheng, W.; Cho, S. J.; Waller, C. L.; Tropsha. A. J. Chem. Inf. Comput. Sci. 1999, 39, 738-746.) and Stochastic Cluster Analysis (SCA; Reynolds. C. H.; Druker, R.; Pfahler, L. B. Lead Discovery Using Stochastic Cluster Analysis (SCA): A New Method for Clustering Structurally Similar Compounds J. Chem. Inf. Comput. Sci. 1998, 38, 305-312.) for their ability to select both diverse and representative subsets of the entire chemical library space. The SAGE and SCA algorithms were compared using u- and s-optimal metrics as an independent assessment of diversity and coverage. This comparison showed that both algorithms were capable of generating sublibraries in descriptor space that are diverse and give reasonable coverage (i.e. are representative) of the original full library. Tests were carried out using simulated two-dimensional data sets and a 27000 compound proprietary structural library as represented by computed Molconn-Z descriptors. One of the key observations from this work is that the algorithmically simple SCA method is capable of selecting subsets that are comparable to the more computationally intensive SAGE method.},

	Abstract = {A common problem in the emerging field of combinatorial drug design is the selection of an appropriate subset of compounds for chemical synthesis and biological evaluation. In this paper, we introduce a new family of selection algorithms that combine a stochastic search engine with a user-defined objective function that encodes any desirable selection criterion. The method is applied to the problem of maximizing molecular diversity, and the results are visualized using Sammon's nonlinear mapping algorithm. By separating the search method from the performance metric, the method can be easily extended to perform complex multiobjective selections in advanced decision-support systems.},

	Abstract = {IcePick is a system for computationally selecting diverse sets of molecules. It computes the dissimilarity of the surface-accessible features of two molecules, taking into account conformational flexibility. Then, the intrinsic diversity of an entire set of molecules is calculated from a spanning tree over the pairwise dissimilarities. IcePick's dissimilarity measure is compared against traditional 2D topological approaches, and the spanning tree diversity measure is compared against commonly used variance techniques. The method has proven easy to implement and is fast enough to be used in selection of reactants for numerous production-sized combinatorial libraries.},

	Abstract = {Determination of molecular similarity plays an important role in analyzing large compound databases in chemical and pharmaceutical research. When molecules are described by binary vectors with bits corresponding to the presence or absence of structural features, the Tanimoto association coefficient is the most commonly used measure of similarity or chemical distance between two compounds. However, when used to select compounds for an optimal spread design, the Tanimoto coefficient produces an intrinsic bias toward smaller compounds. We have developed a new association coefficient that overcomes this bias. This article gives details of the new coefficient and contrasts the two coefficients for selecting diverse sets of compounds from a large collection. When the Tanimoto coefficient is modified as suggested to select a diverse set in the National Cancer Institute and Registry of Toxic Effects of Chemical Substances databases, the average number of features among the selected compounds increases by more than 50\%.},

	Abstract = {In screening for drug discovery, chemists often select a large subset of molecules from a very large database (e.g., select 1,000 molecules from 100,000). To generate diverse leads for drug optimization, highly active compounds in several structurally different chemical classes are sought. Molecules can be characterized by numerical descriptors, and the chosen subset should cover the descriptor space or subspaces formed by several descriptors. We propose a method that concentrates on low-dimensional subspaces, a criterion for uniformity of coverage, and a fast exchange algorithm to optimize the criterion. These methods are illustrated by using a National Cancer Institute database.},

Theoretical Tc distributions were calculated for FPs consisting of up to 67 bit positions which revealed significant statistical preferences of certain Tc values. Calculation of Tc distributions in a large compound database using different FPs mirrored the effects identified by our general analysis. On the basis of these findings, an average Tc is biased by statistically preferred values.},

	Abstract = {Medicinal chemists have traditionally realized assessments of chemical diversity and subsequent compound acquisition, although a recent study suggests that experts are usually inconsistent in reviewing large data sets. To analyze the scaffold diversity of commercially available screening collections, we have developed a general workflow aimed at (1) identifying druglike compounds, (2) clustering them by maximum common substructures (scaffolds), (3) measuring the scaffold diversity encoded by each screening collection independently of its size, and finally (4) merging all common substructures in a nonredundant scaffold library that can easily be browsed by structural and topological queries. Starting from 2.4 million compounds out of 12 commercial sources, four categories of libraries could be identified: large- and medium-sized combinatorial libraries (low scaffold diversity), diverse libraries (medium diversity, medium size), and highly diverse libraries (high diversity, low size). The chemical space covered by the scaffold library can be searched to prioritize scaffold-focused libraries.},

@article{Balducci:1994nx,
	Abstract = {The literature of the past 3 decades reports a large number of algorithms dealing with the perception of a ''smallest set of smallest rings'' (SSSR). However, the vast majority of the published algorithms are based upon heuristic approaches which provide an acceptable answer for some, but not all, possible connected graphs. This proliferation of approximate solutions to the SSSR perception problem arises primarily from the widespread belief that the problem is NP-complete (exponential order). Here, we present a highly efficient exact solution to this problem with a polynomial computational order. Our novel algorithm is based upon the concurrent traversal of a set of N partial breadth-first trees of the structural graph (where N is the number of nodes). The graph is represented as an object-oriented model in which each node acts as a message transceiver in a network. Each message contains the history of the connected path traversed as it propagates through the network. Message collisions correspond to ring closures. This ''chain-message'' algorithm detects a superset of an SSSR of the structure. The rings of this superset are identified in increasing ring size order. The SSSR is then rapidly selected from this set with a series of linear independence tests. The algorithm can be easily extended to accommodate the canonical selection of an application-defined ''preferred'' SSSR. We show that the order of this algorithm is at most O(d3N2 log N), where d is the maximum degree of any node of the sturcture. For chemical structures (for which d much less than N), this algorithm is at most O(N2 log N). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of an exact solution to the ring perception problem with a computational order small enough to be useful in 'real world'' applications.},

	Abstract = {Given an uncharacterized protein sequence, how can we identify whether it is a G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) or not? If it is, which functional family class does it belong to? It is important to address these questions because GPCRs are among the most frequent targets of therapeutic drugs and the information thus obtained is very useful for comparative and evolutionary pharmacology, a technique often used for drug development. Here, we present a web-server predictor called GPCR-CA, where CA stands for Cellular Automaton (Wolfram, S. Nature 1984, 311, 419), meaning that the CA images have been utilized to reveal the pattern features hidden in piles of long and complicated protein sequences. Meanwhile, the gray-level co-occurrence matrix factors extracted from the CA images are used to represent the samples of proteins through their pseudo amino acid composition (Chou, K.C. Proteins 2001, 43, 246). GPCR-CA is a two-layer predictor: the first layer prediction engine is for identifying a query protein as GPCR on non-GPCR; if it is a GPCR protein, the process will be automatically continued with the second-layer prediction engine to further identify its type among the following six functional classes: (a) rhodopsin-like, (b) secretin-like, (c) metabotrophic/glutamate/pheromone; (d) fungal pheromone, (e) cAMP receptor, and (f) frizzled/smoothened family. The overall success rates by the predictor for the first and second layers are over 91% and 83%, respectively, that were obtained through rigorous jackknife cross-validation tests on a new-constructed stringent benchmark dataset in which none of proteins has 40% pairwise sequence identity to any other in a same subset. GPCR-CA is freely accessible at http://218.65.61.89:8080/bioinfo/GPCR-CA, by which one can get the desired two-layer results for a query protein sequence within about 20 seconds.},

@article{Chung:2008gd,
	Abstract = {High-throughput screening (HTS) of large-scale RNA interference (RNAi) libraries has become an increasingly popular method of functional genomics in recent years. Cell-based assays used for RNAi screening often produce small dynamic ranges and significant variability because of the combination of cellular heterogeneity, transfection efficiency, and the intrinsic nature of the genes being targeted. These properties make reliable hit selection in the RNAi screen a difficult task. The use of robust methods based on median and median absolute deviation (MAD) has been suggested to improve hit selection in such cases, but mean and standard deviation (SD)-based methods are still predominantly used in many RNAi HTS. In an experimental approach to compare these 2 methods, a genome-scale small interfering RNA (siRNA) screen was performed, in which the identification of novel targets increasing the therapeutic index of the chemotherapeutic agent mitomycin C (MMC) was sought. MAD values were resistant to the presence of outliers, and the hits selected by the MAD-based method included all the hits that would be selected by SD-based method as well as a significant number of additional hits. When retested in triplicate, a similar percentage of these siRNAs were shown to genuinely sensitize cells to MMC compared with the hits shared between SD- and MAD-based methods. Confirmed hits were enriched with the genes involved in the DNA damage response and cell cycle regulation, validating the overall hit selection strategy. Finally, computer simulations showed the superiority and generality of the MAD-based method in various RNAi HTS data models. In conclusion, the authors demonstrate that the MAD-based hit selection method rescued physiologically relevant false negatives that would have been missed in the SD-based method, and they believe it to be the desirable 1st-choice hit selection method for RNAi screen results.},

@article{Tong:2007ty,
	Abstract = {Rapid throughput of assays for assessing biological activity of compounds, known as high-throughput screening (HTS), has created a need for a statistical analysis of the resulting data. Conventional methods for separating active compounds from inactive compounds based on using only a portion of the screening data to determine the cutoff threshold value are ad hoc and unsatisfactory. Taking full advantage of the entire set of screening data, we assume that the responses can be sorted into two classes; measurements associated with inactive compounds and measurements associated with active compounds. Both theoretical and practical considerations lead us to model the distribution of the measurements of inactive compounds with a Gaussian distribution. The choice is consistent with the data and our analytical experience. In our examples, active compounds inhibit enzyme and the distribution of measurements from those compounds can be characterized by a gamma or a similar one-sided long-tailed distribution. The application of this mixture of Gaussian and gamma distributions describes activity of our screening data very well. Using this model, we will show its reasoning and derivation along with describing how to optimally set the cutoff threshold value in a statistically well-defined manner. This modeling approach provides a new and useful statistical tool for HTS. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

	Abstract = {Computational support for high-content screening (HCS) is of paramount importance at several stages of the process: from the selection of compounds, to the image and data analysis all the way to hit identification and analysis of mechanisms of action. Method: Here, we describe computational approaches to improve the benefit gained from HCS, such as compound selection, image analysis and algorithms to further process and explore HCS data. We describe the current challenges in these areas and state our expectations for the field. Conclusion: At present there are no standard approaches for correction, normalization, analysis or visualization of HCS data. Thus, the information-rich data sets provided by HCS are exploited to only a limited extent. To overcome this shortcoming, a thorough comparison and evaluation of different tools is needed.},

	Abstract = {High-throughput screening is an early critical step in drug discovery. Its aim is to screen a large number of diverse chemical compounds to identify candidate 'hits' rapidly and accurately. Few statistical tools are currently available, however, to detect quality hits with a high degree of confidence. We examine statistical aspects of data preprocessing and hit identification for primary screens. We focus on concerns related to positional effects of wells within plates, choice of hit threshold and the importance of minimizing false-positive and false-negative rates. We argue that replicate measurements are needed to verify assumptions of current methods and to suggest data analysis strategies when assumptions are not met. The integration of replicates with robust statistical methods in primary screens will facilitate the discovery of reliable hits, ultimately improving the sensitivity and specificity of the screening process.},

@article{Johnson:2007rw,
	Abstract = {Among the several goals of a high-throughput screening campaign is the identification of as many active chemotypes as possible for further evaluation. Often, however, the number of concentration response curves (e.g., IC50s or Kis) that can be collected following a primary screen is limited by practical constraints such as protein supply, screening workload, and so forth. One possible approach to this dilemma is to cluster the hits from the primary screen and sample only a few compounds from each cluster. This introduces the question as to how many compounds must be selected from a cluster to ensure that an active compound is identified, if it exists at all. This article seeks to address this question using a Monte Carlo simulation in which the dependence of the success of sampling is directly linked to screening data variability. Furthermore, the authors demonstrate that the use of replicated compounds in the screening collection can easily assess this variability and provide a priori guidance to the screener and chemist as to the extent of sampling required to maximize chemotype identification during the triage process. The individual steps of the Monte Carlo simulation provide insight into the correspondence between the percentage inhibition and eventual IC50 curves.},

@article{Zhang:1999dk,
	Abstract = {The ability to identify active compounds ("hits") from large chemical libraries accurately and rapidly has been the ultimate goal in developing high-throughput screening (HTS) assays. The ability to identify hits from a particular HTS assay depends largely on the suitability or quality of the assay used in the screening. The criteria or parameters for evaluating the "suitability" of an HTS assay for hit identification are not well defined and hence it still remains difficult to compare the quality of assays directly. In this report, a screening window coefficient, called "Z- factor," is defined. This coefficient is reflective of both the assay signal dynamic range and the data variation associated with the signal measurements, and therefore is suitable for assay quality assessment. The Z-factor is a dimensionless, simple statistical characteristic for each HTS assay. The Z-factor provides a useful tool for comparison and evaluation of the quality of assays, and can be utilized in assay optimization and validation.},

Multiple linear regression and computational neural networks are used to train and evaluate models based on statistical indices and overall root-mean-square error. Eight-descriptor models were developed for both surface tension and viscosity, while a nine-descriptor model was developed for thermal conductivity. In addition, a single nine-descriptor model was developed for prediction of all three properties.

	Abstract = {The primary goal of a quantitative structure−property relationship (QSPR) is to identify a set of structurally based numerical descriptors that can be mathematically linked to a property of interest. The types of descriptors fall into three categories:  topological, electronic, and geometric. In this study, 140 organic compounds with diverse structures were split into a training set, a cross-validation set, and a prediction set. The training set was used to build multiple linear regression and computational neural network models, the cross-validation set was used to prevent overtraining of the neural network, and the prediction set was used to validate the mathematical models. A set of nine descriptors was found that effectively linked the aqueous solubility to each structure. However, the polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) had a large root-mean-square (rms) error associated with them. Therefore models were also built using a training set that contained no PCBs. A set of nine descriptors was found with a significant improvement of the rms error of the training set as well as the prediction set.},

@article{Kelly:2009eu,
	Abstract = {Preventing and delaying the emergence of drug resistance is an essential goal of antimalarial drug development. Monotherapy and highly mutable drug targets have each facilitated resistance, and both are undesirable in effective long-term strategies against multi-drug-resistant malaria. Haem remains an immutable and vulnerable target, because it is not parasite-encoded and its detoxification during haemoglobin degradation, critical to parasite survival, can be subverted by drug--haem interaction as in the case of quinolines and many other drugs1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Here we describe a new antimalarial chemotype that combines the haem-targeting character of acridones, together with a chemosensitizing component that counteracts resistance to quinoline antimalarial drugs. Beyond the essential intrinsic characteristics common to deserving candidate antimalarials (high potency in vitro against pan-sensitive and multi-drug-resistant Plasmodium falciparum, efficacy and safety in vivo after oral administration, inexpensive synthesis and favourable physicochemical properties), our initial lead, T3.5 (3-chloro-6-(2-diethylamino-ethoxy)-10-(2-diethylamino-ethyl)-acridone), demonstrates unique synergistic properties. In addition to 'verapamil-like' chemosensitization to chloroquine and amodiaquine against quinoline-resistant parasites, T3.5 also results in an apparently mechanistically distinct synergism with quinine and with piperaquine. This synergy, evident in both quinoline-sensitive and quinoline-resistant parasites, has been demonstrated both in vitro and in vivo. In summary, this innovative acridone design merges intrinsic potency and resistance-counteracting functions in one molecule, and represents a new strategy to expand, enhance and sustain effective antimalarial drug combinations.},

	Abstract = {Open-source software will never achieve ubiquity. There are environments in which it simply does not flourish. By its nature, open-source development requires free exchange of ideas, community involvement, and the efforts of talented and dedicated individuals. However, pressures can come from several sources that prevent this from happening. In addition, openness and complex licensing issues invite misuse and abuse. Care must be taken to avoid the pitfalls of open-source software.

Only now are we beginning to see the social and commercial interplay of open-source software in chemistry and bioinformatics. This can be a positive feature, but the choice to be involved in open source should be made with care.

	Abstract = {Small aromatic ring systems are of central importance in the development of novel synthetic protein ligands. Here we generate a complete list of 24847 such ring systems. We call this list and associated annotations VEHICLe, which stands for virtual exploratory heterocyclic library. Searches of literature and compound databases, using this list as substructure queries, identified only 1701 as synthesized. Using a carefully validated machine learning approach, we were able to estimate that the number of unpublished, but synthetically tractable, VEHICLe rings could be over 3000. However, analysis also shows that the rate of publication of novel examples to be as low as 5‚{\`a}{\'\i}10 per year. With this work, we aim to provide fresh stimulus to creative organic chemists by highlighting a small set of apparently simple ring systems that are predicted to be tractable but are, to the best of our knowledge, unconquered.},

@article{Swamidass:2009lq,
	Abstract = {Given activity training data from high-throughput screening (HTS) experiments, virtual high-throughput screening (vHTS) methods aim to predict in silico the activity of untested chemicals. We present a novel method, the Influence Relevance Voter (IRV), specifically tailored for the vHTS task. The IRV is a low-parameter neural network which refines a k-nearest neighbor classifier by nonlinearly combining the influences of a chemical‚{\"A}{\^o}s neighbors in the training set. Influences are decomposed, also nonlinearly, into a relevance component and a vote component. The IRV is benchmarked using the data and rules of two large, open, competitions, and its performance compared to the performance of other participating methods, as well as of an in-house support vector machine (SVM) method. On these benchmark data sets, IRV achieves state-of-the-art results, comparable to the SVM in one case, and significantly better than the SVM in the other, retrieving three times as many actives in the top 1{\%} of its prediction-sorted list. The IRV presents several other important advantages over SVMs and other methods: (1) the output predictions have a probabilistic semantic; (2) the underlying inferences are interpretable; (3) the training time is very short, on the order of minutes even for very large data sets; (4) the risk of overfitting is minimal, due to the small number of free parameters; and (5) additional information can easily be incorporated into the IRV architecture. Combined with its performance, these qualities make the IRV particularly well suited for vHTS.},

	Abstract = {Most drugs have been continuously modified from prototypic compounds in the drug development process. Such chemical modifications in the history of drug development are expected to contain a wealth of medicinal chemists‚{\"A}{\^o}knowledge, and the KEGG DRUG structure maps have been compiled to capture this knowledge. Here we attempted to extract the information on the chemical modification patterns from 3745 approved drugs in the KEGG DRUG database and 255 drug pairs in the KEGG DRUG structure maps. We first identified 236 core structures and 506 peripheral fragments from the KEGG DRUG database using bit-represented fingerprints and hierarchical clustering of similar structures. We then examined position-dependent relationships between core structures and peripheral fragments, which revealed the tendency of specific fragments connected to specific modification sites on the core structures. Next we converted the drug pairs into 204 peripheral fragment changes at the modification sites. Each change was represented by the transformation profile defined as a difference of fingerprint bit patterns, and the hierarchical clustering of similar transformation profiles was performed. We thus identified 125 chemical modification patterns that characterize the KEGG DRUG structure maps. These patterns were further applied to the reconstruction of a new structure map. The approach presented here may be applicable to systematic in silico drug modifications.},

	Abstract = {Here we describe a novel strategy using multiplexes of synthetic small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) corresponding to multiple gene targets in order to compress RNA interference (RNAi) screen size. Before investigating the practical use of this strategy, we first characterized the gene-specific RNAi induced by a large subset (258 siRNAs, 129 genes) of the entire siRNA library used in this study ( approximately 800 siRNAs, approximately 400 genes). We next demonstrated that multiplexed siRNAs could silence at least six genes to the same degree as when the genes were targeted individually. The entire library was then used in a screen in which randomly multiplexed siRNAs were assayed for their affect on cell viability. Using this strategy, several gene targets that influenced the viability of a breast cancer cell line were identified. This study suggests that the screening of randomly multiplexed siRNAs may provide an important avenue towards the identification of candidate gene targets for downstream functional analyses and may also be useful for the rapid identification of positive controls for use in novel assay systems. This approach is likely to be especially applicable where assay costs or platform limitations are prohibitive.},

	Abstract = {The investigation of protein function through the inhibition of activity has been critical to our understanding of many normal and abnormal biological processes. Until recently, functional inhibition in biological systems has been induced using a variety of approaches including small molecule antagonists, antibodies, aptamers, ribozymes, antisense oligonucleotides or transcripts, morpholinos, dominant-negative mutants, and knockout transgenic animals. Although all of these approaches have made substantial advances in our understanding of the function of many proteins, a lack of specificity or restricted applicability has limited their utility. Recently, exploitation of the naturally occurring posttranscriptional gene silencing mechanism triggered by double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), termed RNA interference (RNAi), has gained much favor as an alternative means for analyzing gene function. Aspects of the basic biology of RNAi, its application as a functional genomics tool, and its potential as a therapeutic approach have been extensively reviewed (Hannon and Rossi, 2004; Meister and Tuschl, 2004); however, there has been only limited discussion as to how to design and validate an individual RNAi effector molecule and how to interpret RNAi data overall, particularly with reference to experimentation in mammalian cells. This perspective will aim to consider some of the issues encountered when conducting and interpreting RNAi experiments in mammalian cells.},

	Abstract = {RNA interference (RNAi) high-throughput screening (HTS) has been hailed as the 2nd genomics wave following the 1st genomics wave of gene expression microarrays and single-nucleotide polymorphism discovery platforms. Following an RNAi HTS, the authors are interested in identifying short interfering RNA (siRNA) hits with large inhibition/activation effects. For hit selection, the z-score method and its variants are commonly used in primary RNAi HTS experiments. Recently, strictly standardized mean difference (SSMD) has been proposed to measure the siRNA effect represented by the magnitude of difference between an siRNA and a negative reference group. The links between SSMD and d+-probability offer a clear interpretation of siRNA effects from a probability perspective. Hence, SSMD can be used as a ranking metric for hit selection. In this article, the authors investigated both the SSMD-based testing process and the use of SSMD as a ranking metric for hit selection in 2 primary siRNA HTS experiments. The analysis results showed that, as a ranking metric, SSMD was more stable and reliable than percentage inhibition and led to more robust hit selection results. Using the SSMD -based testing method, the false-negative rate can more readily be obtained. More important, the use of the SSMD-based method can result in a reduction in both the false-negative and false-positive rates. The applications presented in this article demonstrate that the SSMD method addresses scientific questions and fills scientific needs better than both percentage inhibition and the commonly used z-score method for hit selection.},

	Abstract = {RNA interference (RNAi) high-throughput screening (HTS) experiments carried out using large (>5000 short interfering [si]RNA) libraries generate a huge amount of data. In order to use these data to identify the most effective siRNAs tested, it is critical to adopt and develop appropriate statistical methods. To address the questions in hit selection of RNAi HTS, we proposed a quartile-based method which is robust to outliers, true hits and nonsymmetrical data. We compared it with the more traditional tests, mean +/- k standard deviation (SD) and median +/- 3 median of absolute deviation (MAD). The results suggested that the quartile-based method selected more hits than mean +/- k SD under the same preset error rate. The number of hits selected by median +/- k MAD was close to that by the quartile-based method. Further analysis suggested that the quartile-based method had the greatest power in detecting true hits, especially weak or moderate true hits. Our investigation also suggested that platewise analysis (determining effective siRNAs on a plate-by-plate basis) can adjust for systematic errors in different plates, while an experimentwise analysis, in which effective siRNAs are identified in an analysis of the entire experiment, cannot. However, experimentwise analysis may detect a cluster of true positive hits placed together in one or several plates, while platewise analysis may not. To display hit selection results, we designed a specific figure called a plate-well series plot. We thus suggest the following strategy for hit selection in RNAi HTS experiments. First, choose the quartile-based method, or median +/- k MAD, for identifying effective siRNAs. Second, perform the chosen method experimentwise on transformed/normalized data, such as percentage inhibition, to check the possibility of hit clusters. If a cluster of selected hits are observed, repeat the analysis based on untransformed data to determine whether the cluster is due to an artifact in the data. If no clusters of hits are observed, select hits by performing platewise analysis on transformed data. Third, adopt the plate-well series plot to visualize both the data and the hit selection results, as well as to check for artifacts.},

	Abstract = {RNA interference (RNAi) is a modality in which small double-stranded RNA molecules (siRNAs) designed to lead to the degradation of specific mRNAs are introduced into cells or organisms. siRNA libraries have been developed in which siRNAs targeting virtually every gene in the human genome are designed, synthesized and are presented for introduction into cells by transfection in a microtiter plate array. These siRNAs can then be transfected into cells using high-throughput screening (HTS) methodologies. The goal of RNAi HTS is to identify a set of siRNAs that inhibit or activate defined cellular phenotypes. The commonly used analysis methods including median +/- kMAD have issues about error rates in multiple hypothesis testing and plate-wise versus experiment-wise analysis. We propose a methodology based on a Bayesian framework to address these issues. Our approach allows for sharing of information across plates in a plate-wise analysis, which obviates the need for choosing either a plate-wise or experimental-wise analysis. The proposed approach incorporates information from reliable controls to achieve a higher power and a balance between the contribution from the samples and control wells. Our approach provides false discovery rate (FDR) control to address multiple testing issues and it is robust to outliers.},

	Abstract = {In modern drug discovery, 2-D similarity searching is widely employed as a cost-effective way to screen large compound collections and select subsets of molecules that may have interesting biological activity prior to experimental screening. Nowadays, there is a growing interest in applying the existing 2-D similarity searching methods to combinatorial chemistry libraries to search for novel hits or to evolve lead series. A dilemma thus arises when many identical substructures recur in library products and they have to be considered repeatedly in descriptor calculations. The dilemma is exacerbated by the astronomical number of combinatorial products. This problem imposes a major barrier to similarity searching of large combinatorial chemistry spaces. An efficient approach, termed Monomer-based Similarity Searching (MoBSS), is proposed to remedy the problem. MoBSS calculates atom pair (AP) descriptors based on interatomic topological distances, which lend themselves to pair additivity. A fast algorithm is employed in MoBSS to rapidly compute product atom pairs from those of the constituent fragments. The details of the algorithm are presented along with a series of proof-of-concept studies, which demonstrate the speed, accuracy, and utility of the MoBSS approach.},

	Annote = { Application of knowledge discovery methods to crystal structure databases is an emerging research area of materials science that is playing an important role in facilitating data analysis. This study is aimed at combining computational geometry methods with machine learning algorithms for classification of inorganic solid materials of known structure. Zeolite crystals are used for the pilot study where a model based on the topology is developed for classification of the compound by mineral name and by zeolite framework type. The topological descriptors are derived from the Delaunay tessellation for 220 zeolites contained in the inorganic crystal structure database. This zeolite-structure-predictor (ZSP) is trained for classifying this set of selected zeolite crystals into 22 different types of minerals and into 13 framework types. The ZSP is based on the random forest algorithm and contains attributes of Delaunay simplex properties such as tetrahedrality index, frequency of simplex occurrence, and site occupation probability. The ZSP is able to obtain classification in this multitude of classes with more than 81% of correctly classified instances based on framework type. The model shows that the classification into framework types is superior, and that the classification into mineral names is not structurally unique.},

	Abstract = {There are many drugs described with very different affinity to a large number of receptors. In this work, we selected drug-receptor pairs (DRPs) of affinity/non-affinity drugs to similar/dissimilar receptors and we represented them as a large network, which may be used to identify drugs that can act on a receptor. Computational chemistry prediction of the biological activity based on Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationships (QSAR) substantially increases the potentialities of this kind of networks avoiding time and resources-consuming experiments. Unfortunately, most QSAR models are unspecific or predict activity against only one receptor. To solve this problem, we developed here a multi-target QSAR (mt-QSAR) classification model. Overall model classification accuracy was 72.25% (1390/1924 compounds) in training, 72.28% (459/635) in cross-validation. Outputs of this mt-QSAR model were used as inputs to construct a network. The observed network has 1735 nodes (DRPs), 1754 edges or Pairs of DRPs with similar drug-target affinity (sPDRPs), and low coverage density d = 0.12%. The predicted network has 1735 DRPs, 1857 sPDRPs, and also low coverage density d = 0.12%. After an edge-to-edge comparison (Chi-square = 9420.3; p < 0.005), we have demonstrated that the predicted network is significantly similar to the one observed and both have a distribution closer to exponential than to normal.},

	Abstract = {Natural products continue to represent an excellent source for lead structures for drug discovery. However, new concepts are required  
to increase the probability of finding new bioactive structures. The post-genomic world has revealed that the traditional culture-based, 
bioassay-guided strategies used to discover natural products have only provided access to a small fraction of the biosynthetic capacity  
encoded in genomes. It has become apparent that the majority of biosynthetic pathways are expressed not at all, or scarcely, under 
laboratory conditions, or the products of these pathways have been overlooked. Genomic mining seeks to address both of these issues 
and thus to exploit the hidden potential of biosynthetic pathways. This fascinating, interdisciplinary research field began to form with the  
turn of the millennium, and, in establishing itself, has opened the door to a new era in natural products drug discovery.

A community-based platform that combines traditional drug discovery informatics with Web2.0 features in secure groups is believed to be the key to facilitating richer, instantaneous collaborations involving sensitive drug discovery data and intellectual property. Heterogeneous chemical and biological data from low-throughput or high-throughput experiments are archived, mined and then selectively shared either just securely between specifically designated colleagues or openly on the Internet in standardized formats. We will illustrate several case studies for anti-malarial research enabled by this platform, which we suggest could be easily expanded more broadly for pharmaceutical research in general.},

	Annote = { Large scale database searching to identify molecules that share a common biological activity for a target of interest is widely used in drug discovery. Such an endeavour requires the availability of a method encoding molecular properties that are indicative of biological activity and at least one active molecule to be used as a template. Molecular shape has been shown to be an important indicator of biological activity; however, currently used methods are relatively slow, so faster and more reliable methods are highly desirable. Recently, a new non-superposition based method for molecular shape comparison, called Ultrafast Shape Recognition (USR), has been devised with computational performance at least three orders of magnitude faster than previously existing methods. In this study, we investigate the performance of USR in retrieving biologically active compounds through retrospective Virtual Screening experiments. Results show that USR performs better on average than a commercially available shape similarity method, while screening conformers at a rate that is more than 2500 times faster. This outstanding computational performance is particularly useful for searching much larger portions of chemical space than previously possible, which makes USR a very valuable new tool in the search for new lead molecules for drug discovery programs.},

	Abstract = {With recent advances in fluorescence microscopy imaging techniques and methods of gene knock down by RNA interference (RNAi), genome-scale high-content screening (HCS) has emerged as a powerful approach to systematically identify all parts of complex biological processes. However, a critical barrier preventing fulfillment of the success is the lack of efficient and robust methods for automating RNAi image analysis and quantitative evaluation of the gene knock down effects on huge volume of HCS data. Facing such opportunities and challenges, we have started investigation of automatic methods towards the development of a fully automatic RNAi--HCS system. Particularly important are reliable approaches to cellular phenotype classification and image-based gene function estimation.

We have developed a HCS analysis platform that consists of two main components: fluorescence image analysis and image scoring. For image analysis, we used a two-step enhanced watershed method to extract cellular boundaries from HCS images. Segmented cells were classified into several predefined phenotypes based on morphological and appearance features. Using statistical characteristics of the identified phenotypes as a quantitative description of the image, a score is generated that reflects gene function. Our scoring model integrates fuzzy gene class estimation and single regression models. The final functional score of an image was derived using the weighted combination of the inference from several support vector-based regression models. We validated our phenotype classification method and scoring system on our cellular phenotype and gene database with expert ground truth labeling.

We built a database of high-content, 3-channel, fluorescence microscopy images of Drosophila Kc167 cultured cells that were treated with RNAi to perturb gene function. The proposed informatics system for microscopy image analysis is tested on this database. Both of the two main components, automated phenotype classification and image scoring system, were evaluated. The robustness and efficiency of our system were validated in quantitatively predicting the biological relevance of genes.},

	Abstract = {Prediction of protein function is of significance in studying biological processes. One approach for function prediction is to classify a protein into functional family. Support vector machine (SVM) is a useful method for such classification, which may involve proteins with diverse sequence distribution. We have developed a web-based software, SVMProt, for SVM classification of a protein into functional family from its primary sequence. SVMProt classification system is trained from representative proteins of a number of functional families and seed proteins of Pfam curated protein families. It currently covers 54 functional families and additional families will be added in the near future. The computed accuracy for protein family classification is found to be in the range of 69.1-99.6\%. SVMProt shows a certain degree of capability for the classification of distantly related proteins and homologous proteins of different function and thus may be used as a protein function prediction tool that complements sequence alignment methods. SVMProt can be accessed at http://jing.cz3.nus.edu.sg/cgi-bin/svmprot.cgi.},

	Abstract = {The EC (Enzyme Commission) numbers represent a hierarchical classification of enzymatic reactions, but they are also commonly utilized as identifiers of enzymes or enzyme genes in the analysis of complete genomes. This duality of the EC numbers makes it possible to link the genomic repertoire of enzyme genes to the chemical repertoire of metabolic pathways, the process called metabolic reconstruction. Unfortunately, there are numerous reactions known to be present in various pathways, but they will never get EC numbers because the EC number assignment requires published articles on full characterization of enzymes. Here we report a computerized method to automatically assign the EC numbers up to the sub-subclasses, i.e., without the fourth serial number for substrate specificity, given pairs of substrates and products. The method is based on a new classification scheme of enzymatic reactions, named the RC (reaction classification) number. Each reaction in the current dataset of the EC numbers is first decomposed into reactant pairs. Each pair is then structurally aligned to identify the reaction center, the matched region, and the difference region. The RC number represents the conversion patterns of atom types in these three regions. We examined the correspondence between computationally assigned RC numbers and manually assigned EC numbers by the jackknife cross-validation test and found that the EC sub-subclasses could be assigned with the accuracy of about 90\%. Furthermore, we examined the correlation with genomic information as represented by the KEGG ortholog clusters (OC) and confirmed that the RC numbers are correlated not only with elementary reaction mechanisms but also with protein families.},

	Abstract = {Using a well-defined set of fragments/pharmacophores, a new methodology to calculate fragment/pharmacophore descriptors for any molecule onto which at least one fragment/pharmacophore can be mapped is presented. To each fragment/pharmacophore present in a molecule, we attach a descriptor that is calculated by identifying the molecule's atoms onto which it maps and summing over its constituent atomic descriptors. The attached descriptors are named C-fragment/pharmacophore descriptors, and this methodology can be applied to any descriptors defined at the atomic level, such as the partition coefficient, molar refractivity, electrotopological state, etc. By using this methodology, the same fragment/pharmacophore can be shown to have different values in different molecules resulting in better discrimination power. As we know, fragment and pharmacophore fingerprints have a lot of applications in chemical informatics. This study has attempted to find the impact of replacing the traditional value of ``1'' in a fingerprint with real numbers derived form C-fragment/pharmacophore descriptors. One way to do this is to assess the utility of C-fragment/pharmacophore descriptors in modeling different end points. Here, we exemplify with data from CYP and hERG. The fact that, in many cases, the obtained models were fairly successful and C-fragment descriptors were ranked among the top ones supports the idea that they play an important role in correlation. When we modeled hERG with C-pharmacophore descriptors, however, the model performances decreased slightly, and we attribute this, mainly to the fact that there is no technique capable of handling multiple instances (states). We hope this will open new research, especially in the emerging field of machine learning. Further research is needed to see the impact of C-fragment/pharmacophore descriptors in similarity/dissimilarity applications.},

	Abstract = {In this work, four reliable aqueous solubility models, ASM-ATC (aqueous solubility model based on atom type counts), ASM-ATC-LOGP (aqueous solubility model based on atom type counts and ClogP as an additional descriptor), ASM-SAS (aqueous solubility model based on solvent accessible surface areas), and ASM-SAS-LOGP (aqueous solubility model based on solvent accessible surface areas and ClogP as an additional descriptor), have been developed for a diverse data set of 3664 compounds. All four models were extensively validated by various cross-validation tests, and encouraging predictability was achieved. ASM-ATC-LOGP, the best model, achieves leave-one-out correlation coefficient square (q2) and root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 0.832 and 0.840 logarithm unit, respectively. In a 10,000 times 85/15 cross-validation test, this model achieves the mean of q2 and RMSE being 0.832 and 0.841 logarithm unit, respectively. We believe that those robust models can serve as an important rule in druglikeness analysis and an efficient filter in prioritizing compound libraries prior to high throughput screenings (HTS).},

The resulting network representations make it possible to focus on different local SAR environments in screening data. We have designed a simple scoring function accounting for similarity and potency relationships among hits that identifies SAR pathways leading from active compounds in different SAR contexts to key compounds forming activity cliffs. From these pathways, SAR information can be extracted and utilized to select hits for further analysis. In clusters of hits related by different local SARs, alternative pathways can be systematically explored and ranked according to SAR information content, which makes it possible to prioritize hits in a consistent manner.},

We describe a new type of descriptor of this type, the charge fingerprint.

We report a synthesis strategy that involves transforming substrates with different appendages that pre-encode skeletal information, named sigma elements, into products that have different skeletons with the use of common reaction conditions. With this approach, split-pool synthesis can be used to pre-encode skeletal diversity combinatorially and thereby generate such small molecules very efficiently. A split-pool synthesis of more than 1000 compounds produced overlapping, combinatorial matrices of molecular skeletons and appended building blocks in both enantiomeric and diastereomeric forms.},

	Abstract = {Modern drug discovery often involves screening small molecules for their ability to bind to a preselected protein target. Target-oriented syntheses of these small molecules, individually or as collections (focused Libraries), can be planned effectively with retrosynthetic analysis. Drug discovery can also involve screening small molecules for their ability to modulate a biological pathway in cells or organisms, without regard for any particular protein target. This process is Likely to benefit in the future from an evolving forward analysis of synthetic pathways, used in diversity-oriented synthesis, that Leads to structurally complex and diverse small molecules. One goal of diversity-oriented syntheses is to synthesize efficiently a collection of small molecules capable of perturbing any disease-related biological pathway, Leading eventually to the identification of therapeutic protein targets capable of being modulated by small molecules. Several synthetic planning principles for diversity-oriented synthesis and their role in the drug discovery process are presented in this review.},

	Abstract = {Similarity searching for peptide-like small molecules is a difficult task because the amide backbone shared by these molecules tends to mask features that determine biological activity. We have investigated 2D fingerprints for their ability to differentiate between peptide-like molecules having different activity or to facilitate a peptidomimetic transition from molecules with strong peptide character to compounds having little or none. For these purposes, different compound activity classes were assembled consisting of molecules having strong, moderate, and weak peptide character. For the quantification of peptide character, a ``peptide flavor'' index was introduced. In systematic search calculations, an encouraging finding has been that most of the investigated 2D fingerprints were capable of distinguishing between peptide-like molecules having different activities. However, only two fingerprints of different design also displayed a strong tendency to detect molecules with decreasing peptide character. One of these search tools is a recently introduced property descriptor-based fingerprint that showed two additional advantages:  its flexible design could be adjusted to increasingly recover molecules with little peptide-likeness, and in addition, its search performance was not affected by differences in molecular size.},

	Abstract = {Natural products (NPs) have been optimized in a very long natural selection process for optimal interactions with biological macromolecules. NPs are therefore an excellent source of validated substructures for the design of novel bioactive molecules. Various cheminformatics techniques can provide useful help in analyzing NPs, and the results of such studies may be used with advantage in the drug discovery process. In the present study we describe a method to calculate the natural product-likeness scorea Bayesian measure which allows for the determination of how molecules are similar to the structural space covered by natural products. This score is shown to efficiently separate NPs from synthetic molecules in a cross-validation experiment. Possible applications of the NP-likeness score are discussed and illustrated on several examples including virtual screening, prioritization of compound libraries toward NP-likeness, and design of building blocks for the synthesis of NP-like libraries.},

	Abstract = {Natural products that act as highly specific, small-molecule protein-binding agents and as modulators of protein-protein interactions are highly complex and exhibit functional groups with three-dimensional and stereochemical diversity. The complex three-dimensional display of chiral functional groups appears to be crucial for exhibiting specificity in protein binding and in differentiating between closely related proteins. The development of methods that allow a high-throughput access to three-dimensional, skelatally complex, polycyclic compounds having few asymmetric diversity sites is essential and a highly challenging task. In the postgenomic chemical biology age, in which there is a great desire to understand protein-protein interactions and to dissect protein networking-based signaling pathways by small molecules, the need for developing ``stereocontrolled, diversity-oriented synthesis'' methods to generate natural product-like libraries is of utmost importance.},

The input consists of the molecules themselves, possibly some of the scaffolds, and possibly information about the relation between the substitution points of these scaffolds. Three new algorithms are presented: multiple scaffold detection, common scaffold alignment, and scaffold substructure assignment. Each of these steps is relevant for cases when either none, some, or all information about the common scaffolds and their substitution patterns is available. Each of these problems must be solved in an optimal way in order to produce useful structure−activity correlations. The output consists of a collection of scaffolds, a common numbering system, and a unique mapping of each molecule to a single scaffold substructure. This information can then be used to produce data for structure−activity analysis of medicinal chemistry project databases.},

It is based on the perfect, i.e., conductor-like, screening of the solute molecule and a quantitative calculation of the deviations from ideality appearing in real solvents. Thus, a new point of view to solvation phenomena is presented, which provides an alternative access to many questions of scientific and technical importance. The whole theory is based on the results of molecular orbital continuum solvation models. A few representative solvents are considered, and the use of the theory is demonstrated by the calculation of vapor pressures, surface tensions, and octanol/water partition coefficients.},

	Abstract = {The continuum solvation model COSMO and its extension beyond the dielectric approximation (COSMO RS) have been carefully parametrized in order to optimally reproduce 642 data points for a variety of properties, i.e., Delta G of hydration, vapor pressure, and the partition coefficients for octanol/water, benzene/water, hexane/ water, and diethyl ether/water. Two hundred seventeen small to medium sized neutral molecules, covering most of the chemical functionality of the elements H, C, N, O, and Cl, have been considered. An overall accuracy of 0.4 (rms) kcal/mol for chemical potential differences, corresponding to a factor of 2 in the equilibrium constants under consideration, has been achieved. This was using only a single radius and one dispersion constant per element and a total number of eight COSMO-RS inherent parameters. Most of these parameters were close to their theoretical estimate. The optimized cavity radii agreed well with the widely accepted rule of 120\% of van der Weals radii. The whole parametrization was based upon density functional calculations using DMol/COSMO. As a result of this sound parametrization, we are now able to calculate almost any chemical equilibrium in liquid/liquid and vapor/liquid systems up to an accuracy of a factor 2 without the need of any additional experimental data for solutes or solvents. This opens a wide range of applications in physical chemistry and chemical engineering.},

@article{Mullins:2008aa,
	Abstract = {Thermodynamic methods based on COSMO (COnductor-like Screening MOdels), such as COSMO-RS (Real Solvent) and COSMO-SAC (Segment Activity Coefficient), represent significant and recent developments of solvation thermodynamics and computational quantum mechanics. These are a priori prediction methods based on molecular structures and a few parameters that are fixed for all of the compounds. They require no experimental data and rely on sigma profiles specific to each molecule as their only input. A sigma profile is the probability distribution of a molecular surface segment having a specific charge density. Generating sigma profiles by quantum mechanical calculations represents the most time-consuming and computationally expensive aspect of using COSMO-based methods. This article presents a free, web-based VT-2006 Solute Sigma Profile Database for large, pharmaceutical-related solutes, to supplement the published VT-2005 Sigma Profile Database for solvents and small molecules (www.design.che.vt.edu). Together, these databases contain sigma profiles for 1645 unique compounds, enabling the users to predict binary and multicomponent vapor-liquid equilibrium (VLE) and solid-liquid equilibrium (SLE), as well, as other thermodynamic properties. We validate the VT-2006 Solute Sigma Profile Database by solid solubility predictions in pure solvents for 2434 literature solubility values, which include 194 solutes, 160 solvents, and 1356 solute-solvent pairs. We also compare solubility predictions for mixed solvents to literature values for 39 systems. By comparison with experimental data, we find a root-mean-squared error (RMSE) of 0.7419 between experimental and predicted solute mole fractions (x(sol)) on a log(10) (x(sol)) scale for solubilities in pure solvents. This article also presents examples investigating the effects of conformational isomerism on solubility predictions of small, medium-sized, and large drug molecules. To provide better understanding of accuracy, we compare a priori COSMO-SAC solubility predictions, which use molecule-specific sigma profiles, to those by the non-random two-liquid segment activity coefficient (NRTL-SAC) model, which uses regressed molecule-specific parameters, for 17 solutes and 258 experimental solubility values. We find that NRTL-SAC, which contains regressed parameters based on experimental data, is a more accurate method for predicting SLE behavior than the COSMO-SAC model for many of the systems studied. Finally, this article presents a set of guidelines for applying the COSMO-SAC model for solubility predictions for new drug molecules when no experimental data are available.},

	Abstract = {Solvation models, based on fundamental chemical structure theory, were developed in the SPARC mechanistic tool box to predict a large array of physical properties of organic compounds in water and in non-aqueous solvents strictly from molecular structure. The SPARC self-interaction solvation models that describe the intermolecular interaction between like molecules (solute-solute or solvent-solvent) were extended to quantify solute-solvent interaction energy in order to estimate the activity coefficient in almost any solvent. Solvation models that include dispersion, induction, dipole-dipole and hydrogen bonding interactions are used to describe the intermolecular interaction upon placing an organic solute molecule in any single or mixed solvent system. In addition to estimation of the activity coefficient for 2674 organic compounds, these solvation models were validated on solubility and liquid/liquid distribution coefficient in more than 163 solvents including water. The RMS deviations of the calculated versus observed activity coefficients, solubilities and liquid/liquid distribution coefficients were 0.272 log mole fraction, 0.487 log mole fraction and 0.44 log units, respectively.},

	Abstract = {This work presents new experimental results for the CO2 solubility in aqueous blends of diethanolamine (DEA) + N-methyl diethanolamine (NIDEA) in the temperature range of 303-323 K and CO2 partial pressure of 1-100kPa. The concentrations of the aqueous amine blends were 1.5 mass\% DEA + 28.5 mass\% MDEA, 3 mass\% DEA + 27 mass\% MDEA, and 4.5 mass\% DEA + 25.5 mass\% NIDEA. A rigorous thermodynamic model is developed to correlate and predict the vapour-hquid equilibrium (VLE) of CO2 in aqueous blends of DEA + MDEA. The modified Clegg-Pitzer equations have been used to develop the model for the quaternary system (CO2 + MDEA + DEA + H2O) using the interaction parameters derived from the VLE data of the corresponding ternary systems CO2 + MDEA + H2O and CO2 + DEA + H2O. Simulated annealing, a non-traditional algorithm, has been used for parameter estimation and for the determination of equilibrium composition of various species present in the liquid phase. The model predictions have been in good agreement with the experimental data of CO2 solubility in DEA + MDEA blends of this work as well as those reported in the literature. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

	Abstract = {The design of sour-gas treating processes with alkanolamine solvents requires knowledge of the vapour-liquid equilibrium (VLE) of the aqueous acid gas-alkanolamine systems. Representation of the experimental data with a thermodynamically rigorous model is required, so that one can systematically correlate and predict the VLEs of these systems. The modified Clegg-Pitzer equations have been used to correlate and predict the VLE Of CO2 in the aqueous N-methyldiethanolamine (MDEA) and 2-amino-2-methyl-1-propanol (AMP) systems. Differential evolution (DE), an evolutionary computational technique, has been used for parameter estimation of the developed VILE model in an effort to predict the VLE of CO2 in aqueous MDEA and AMP solutions with a comparable accuracy to that by using the non-traditional simulated annealing (SA) and deterministic technique like Levenberg-Marquardt (LM), if not better. In this work, the DE/rand-best/1/bin strategy has been used for finding near global minimum solutions to the multivariable optimization problem as a part of the numerical solution of the developed model.},

	Abstract = {The capability of the extended forms, of two well established cosolvency models, i.e. the combined nearly ideal binary solvent/Redlich-Kister equation and the modified Wilson model, used to predict the solute solubility in non-aqueous ternary solvent mixtures is presented. These predictions are based on the measured solubilities of anthracene in binary solvent mixtures. As a result the values of average percent deviations were less than 2\% for the anthracene solubility. in ternary mixtures.

This work was also extended to other cosolvency models, ie. the extended Hildebrand solubility approach and the mixture response surface method, which are also commonly used for correlating solubility data in ternary solvents. The accuracy of the models is compared with each other and also with a published solubility model for ternary mixtures. The results illustrate that all models produced comparable accuracy.},

	Abstract = {A cosolvency model to predict the solubility of drugs at several temperatures was derived from the excess free energy model of Williams and Amidon. The solubility of oxolinic acid, an antibacterial drug, was measured in aqueous (water+ethanol) and non-aqueous (ethanol+ethyl acetate) mixtures at several temperatures (20, 30, 35, 40 degreesC). Oxolinic acid displays a solubility maximum in each solvent mixture at solubility parameter values of 32 and 22 MPa1/2. The temperature and heat of fusion were determined from differential scanning calorimetry.. The solvent mixtures do not produce any solid phase change during the solubility experiments. The experimental results and those from the literature were employed to examine the accuracy and prediction capability of the proposed model. An equation was obtained to represent the drug solubility changes with cosolvent concentration and temperature. The model was also tested using a small number of experimental solubilities at 20 and 40degreesC showing reasonably accurate predictions. This is important in pharmaceutics because it save experiments that are often expensive and time consuming.},

The algorithm calls a conformer generator, then performs an agglomerative hierarchical clustering with the modified clustering gain as the stop criterion. The number of classes is computed without an arbitrary parameter. A representative conformer is selected in each class, and nonrepresentative conformers are discarded. For illustration, the algorithm has been applied on a database containing 70 ligands of the cytochrome CYP 3A4, showing that the structural flexibility of each ligand is indeed handled via a small number of its representative conformers. The method is valid for all small molecules.},

	Abstract = {Methods for analyzing complete gene families are becoming of increasing importance to the drug discovery process, because similarities and differences within a family are often the key to understanding functional differences that can be exploited in drug design. We undertake a large-scale structural comparison of protein kinase ATP-binding sites using a geometric hashing method. Subsequently, we propose a relevant classification of the protein kinase family based on the structural similarity of its binding sites. Our classification is not only able to reveal the great diversity of different protein kinases and therefore their different potential for inhibitor selectivity but it is also able to distinguish subtle differences within binding site conformation reflecting the protein activation state. Furthermore, using experimental inhibition profiling, we demonstrate that our classification can be used to identify protein kinase binding sites that are known experimentally to bind the same drug, demonstrating that it has potential as an inverse (protein) virtual screening tool, by identifying which other sites have the potential to bind a given drug. In this way the cross-reactivities of the anticancer drugs Tarceva and Gleevec are rationalized.},

@article{Tang:2009aa,
	Abstract = {Inhibitors of histone deacetylases (HDACIs) have emerged as a new class of drugs for the treatment of human cancers and other diseases because of their effects on cell growth, differentiation, and apoptosis. In this study we have developed several quantitative structure−activity relationship (QSAR) models for 59 chemically diverse histone deacetylase class 1 (HDAC1) inhibitors. The variable selection k nearest neighbor (kNN) and support vector machines (SVM) QSAR modeling approaches using both MolconnZ and MOE chemical descriptors generated from two-dimensional rendering of compounds as chemical graphs have been employed. We have relied on a rigorous model development workflow including the division of the data set into training, test, and external sets and extensive internal and external validation. Highly predictive QSAR models were generated with leave-one-out cross-validated (LOO-CV) q2 and external R2 values as high as 0.80 and 0.87, respectively, using the kNN/MolconnZ approach and 0.93 and 0.87, respectively, using the SVM/MolconnZ approach. All validated QSAR models were employed concurrently for virtual screening (VS) of an in-house compound collection including 9.5 million molecules compiled from the ZINC7.0 database, the World Drug Index (WDI) database, the ASINEX Synergy libraries, and other commercial databases. VS resulted in 45 structurally unique consensus hits that were considered novel putative HDAC1 inhibitors. These computational hits had several novel structural features that were not present in the original data set. Four computational hits with novel scaffolds were tested experimentally, and three of them were confirmed active against HDAC1, with IC50 values for the most active compound of 1.00 μM. The fourth compound was later identified to be a selective inhibitor of HDAC6, a Class II HDAC. Moreover, two of the confirmed hits are marketed drugs, which could potentially facilitate their further development as anticancer agents. This study illustrates the power of the combined QSAR-VS method as a general approach for the effective identification of structurally novel bioactive compounds.},

	Abstract = {The histo-aspartic protease (HAP) from the malaria parasite P. falciparum is one of several new promising targets for drug intervention. The enzyme possesses a novel type of active site, but its 3D structure and mechanism of action are still unknown. Here we use a combination of homology modeling, automated docking searches, and molecular dynamics/reaction free energy profile simulations to predict the enzyme structure, conformation of bound substrate, catalytic mechanism, and rate of the peptide cleavage reaction. We find that the computational tools are sufficiently reliable both for identifying substrate binding modes and for distinguishing between different possible reaction mechanisms. It is found that the favored pathway only involves direct participation by the catalytic aspartate, with the neighboring histidine providing critical stabilization (by a factor of similar to10000) along the reaction. The calculated catalytic rate constant of about 0.1 s(-1) for a hexapeptide substrate derived from the alpha chain of human hemoglobin is in excellent agreement with experimental kinetic data for a similar peptide fragment.},

	Abstract = {Efficient drugs such as statins or mevinic acids are inhibitors of the rate-limiting enzyme of cholesterol biosynthesis, 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HMGR), an enzyme responsible for the double reduction of 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl coenzyme A into mevalonic acid. These compounds promoted the synthesis and evaluation of new inhibitors for HMGR, named HMGRIs. The high number of possible candidates creates the necessity of Quantitative Structure--Activity Relationship models in order to guide the HMGRI synthesis. There are two main problems of the reported QSAR models: the homogeneous series of the compounds and the chirality of many candidates. In this work, we propose for the first time a QSAR model for a very large and heterogeneous series of HMGRIs. The model is based on the Topological Indices (TIs) of molecular structures. Using the predictions of this model as input, we construct the first complex network that describes the drug--drug similarity relationships for more than 1600 experimentally non-explored chiral HMGRIs isomers. We also presented a reduced version of this network (Giant Component) that contains the most representative set of chiral HMGRI candidates. The work suggests a new mixed application in the QSAR study of relevant aspects of structural diversity by using chiral/non-chiral TIs, combined with complex networks.},

In this paper, we describe two new algorithms based on the frequent clique detection in the molecular graphs. The first algorithm mines all frequent cliques that are present in at least one of the conformers of each (or a portion of all) molecules. The second algorithm exploits the similarities among the different conformers of the same molecule and achieves an order of magnitude performance speedup compared to the first algorithm. Both algorithms are guaranteed to find all common pharmacophores in the data set, which is confirmed by the validation on the set of molecules for which pharmacophores have been determined experimentally. In addition, these algorithms are able to scale to data sets with arbitrarily large number of conformers per molecule and identify multiple ligand binding modes or multiple binding sites of the target.},

	Abstract = {High throughput docking (HTD) using high performance computing platforms is a multidisciplinary challenge. To handle HTD data effectively and efficiently, we have developed a distributed virtual screening data management system (DVSDMS) in which the data handling and the distribution of jobs are realized by the open-source structured query language database software MySQL. The essential concept of DVSDMS is the separation of the data management from the docking and ranking applications. DVSDMS can be used to dock millions of molecules effectively, monitor the process in real time, analyze docking results promptly, and process up to 108 poses by energy ranking techniques. In an HTD campaign to identify kinase inhibitors a low cost Linux PC has allowed DVSDMS to efficiently assign the workload to more than 500 computing clients. Notably, in a stress test of DVSDMS that emulated a large number of clients, about 60 molecules per second were distributed to the clients for docking, which indicates that DVSDMS can run efficiently on very large compute cluster (up to about 40000 cores).},

In this paper we present TauThor, a tool to enumerate tautomers and predict tautomer stability in the aqueous medium. The enumeration is based on a recursive process that generates tautomers according to the general scheme HX-Y=Z ⇋ X=Y-ZH. The stability of a tautomer is calculated by using a library of 145 fragments associated with experimental tautomeric percentages in water and a pKa based-method that utilizes pKa values predicted by MoKa. Predicted tautomeric ratios based on pKa calculations were benchmarked against literature data for a set of eleven compounds. The FDA approved drugs database, the NCI database and two vendor databases - Specs Screening Library and Asinex Gold Collection - were used to illustrate the impact of tautomerism on chemical libraries and to evaluate the relative occurrences of alternative tautomeric forms.},

@article{Bender:2008aa,
	Abstract = {Different molecular descriptors capture different aspects of molecular structures, but this effect has not yet been quantified systematically on a large scale. In this work, we calculate the similarity of 37 descriptors by repeatedly selecting query compounds and ranking the rest of the database. Euclidean distances between the rank-ordering of different descriptors are calculated to determine descriptor (as opposed to compound) similarity, followed by PCA for visualization. Four broad descriptor classes are identified, which are circular fingerprints; circular fingerprints considering counts; path-based and keyed fingerprints; and pharmacophoric descriptors. Descriptor behavior is much more defined by those four classes than the particular parametrization. Using counts instead of the presence/absence of fingerprints significantly changes descriptor behavior, which is crucial for performance of topological autocorrelation vectors, but not circular fingerprints. Four-point pharmacophores (piDAPH4) surprisingly lead to much higher retrieval rates than three-point pharmacophores (28.21% vs 19.15%) but still similar rank-ordering of compounds (retrieval of similar actives). Looking into individual rankings, circular fingerprints seem more appropriate than path-based fingerprints if complex ring systems or branching patterns are present; count-based fingerprints could be more suitable in databases with a large number of repeated subunits (amide bonds, sugar rings, terpenes). Information-based selection of diverse fingerprints for consensus scoring (ECFP4/TGD fingerprints) led only to marginal improvement over single fingerprint results. While it seems to be nontrivial to exploit orthogonal descriptor behavior to improve retrieval rates in consensus virtual screening, those descriptors still each retrieve different actives which corroborates the strategy of employing diverse descriptors individually in prospective virtual screening settings.},

	Abstract = {The amount of high-throughput screening (HTS) data readily available has significantly increased because of the PubChem project (http://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/). There is considerable opportunity for data mining of small molecules for a variety of biological systems using cheminformatic tools and the resources available through PubChem. In this work, we trained a support vector machine (SVM) classifier using the Signature molecular descriptor on factor XIa inhibitor HTS data. The optimal number of Signatures was selected by implementing a feature selection algorithm of highly correlated clusters. Our method included an improvement that allowed clusters to work together for accuracy improvement, where previous methods have scored clusters on an individual basis. The resulting model had a 10-fold cross-validation accuracy of 89%, and additional validation was provided by two independent test sets. We applied the SVM to rapidly predict activity for approximately 12 million compounds also deposited in PubChem. Confidence in these predictions was assessed by considering the number of Signatures within the training set range for a given compound, defined as the overlap metric. To further evaluate compounds identified as active by the SVM, docking studies were performed using AutoDock. A focused database of compounds predicted to be active was obtained with several of the compounds appreciably dissimilar to those used in training the SVM. This focused database is suitable for further study. The data mining technique presented here is not specific to factor XIa inhibitors, and could be applied to other bioassays in PubChem where one is looking to expand the search for small molecules as chemical probes.},

The essence of the new method is that the molecular framework in a family of drug candidates are divided into several fragments according to their substitutes being investigated. The bioactivities of molecules are correlated with the physicochemical properties of the molecular fragments through two sets of coefficients in the linear free energy equations. One coefficient set is for the physicochemical properties and the other for the weight factors of the molecular fragments. Meanwhile, an iterative double least square (IDLS) technique is developed to solve the two sets of coefficients in a training data set alternately and iteratively. The IDLS technique is a feedback procedure with machine learning ability. The standard Two-dimensional quantitative structure-activity relationship (2D-QSAR) is a special case, in the FB-QSAR, when the whole molecule is treated as one entity. The FB-QSAR approach can remarkably enhance the predictive power and provide more structural insights into rational drug design. As an example, the FB-QSAR is applied to build a predictive model of neuraminidase inhibitors for drug development against H5N1 influenza virus. {\copyright} 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

	Abstract = {The biotin-tagged electrophiles 1-biotinamido-4-(4′-[maleimidoethylcyclohexane]-carboxamido)butane (BMCC) and N-iodoacetyl-N-biotinylhexylenediamine (IAB) have been used as model electrophile probes in complex proteomes to identify protein targets associated with chemical toxicity. Whereas IAB activates stress signaling and apoptosis in HEK293 cells, BMCC does not. Cysteine Michael adducts formed from BMCC and nonbiotinylated analogues rapidly disappeared in the intact cells, whereas the adducts were stable in BMCC-treated subcellular fractions, even in the presence of the cellular reductants reduced glutathione, NADH, and NADPH. In contrast, cysteine thioether adducts formed from IAB and its nonbiotinylated analogues were stable in intact cells. Loss of the BMCC adduct in cells was reduced at 4 $\,^{\circ}$C, which suggests the involvement of a metabolic process in adduct removal. Model studies with a glutathione−BMCC conjugate indicated rapid hydrolysis of the adducted imide ring, but neither the conjugate nor its hydrolysis product dissociated to release the electrophile in neutral aqueous buffer at significant rates. The results suggest that low BMCC toxicity reflects facile repair that results in transient adduction, which fails to trigger damage-signaling pathways.},

	Abstract = {The description of quantitative structure−activity relationship (QSAR) models has been a topic for scientific research for more than 40 years and a topic within the regulatory framework for more than 20 years. At present, efforts on QSAR development are increasing because of their promise for supporting reduction, refinement, and/or replacement of animal toxicity experiments. However, their acceptance in risk assessment seems to require a more standardized and scientific underpinning of QSAR technology to avoid possible pitfalls. For this reason, guidelines for QSAR model development recently proposed by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) [] are expected to help increase the acceptability of QSAR models for regulatory purposes. The guidelines recommend that QSAR models should be associated with (i) a defined end point, (ii) an unambiguous algorithm, (iii) a defined domain of applicability, (iv) appropriate measures of goodness-of-fit, robustness, and predictivity, and (v) a mechanistic interpretation, if possible [ The present perspective provides an overview of these guidelines for QSAR model development and their rationale, as well as the promises and pitfalls of using QSAR approaches and these guidelines for predicting metabolism and toxicity of new and existing chemicals.},

	Abstract = {Multitarget drugs have been to be found effective in controlling complex diseases. However, how to design multitarget drugs presents a great challenge. We have developed a computer-assisted strategy to screen for multitarget inhibitors using a combination of molecular docking and common pharmacophore matching. This strategy was successfully applied to screen for dual-target inhibitors against both the human leukotriene A4 hydrolase (LTA4H-h) and the human nonpancreatic secretory phospholipase A2 (hnps-PLA2). Three compounds screened from the chemical database MDL Available Chemical Directory were found to inhibit these two enzymes at the 10 μM level. Moreover, one synthetic compound matching the common pharmacophores inhibits LTA4H-h and hnps-PLA2 with IC50 values of 35 nM and 7.3 μM, respectively. The common pharmacophore model can also be used to search small molecule databases or collections of existing inhibitors, as well as to guide combinatorial library design to search for ideal multitarget inhibitors.},

	Abstract = {Community detection and analysis is an important methodology for understanding the organization of various real-world networks and has applications in problems as diverse as consensus formation in social communities or the identification of functional modules in biochemical networks. Currently used algorithms that identify the community structures in large-scale real-world networks require a priori information such as the number and sizes of communities or are computationally expensive. In this paper we investigate a simple label propagation algorithm that uses the network structure alone as its guide and requires neither optimization of a predefined objective function nor prior information about the communities. In our algorithm every node is initialized with a unique label and at every step each node adopts the label that most of its neighbors currently have. In this iterative process densely connected groups of nodes form a consensus on a unique label to form communities. We validate the algorithm by applying it to networks whose community structures are known. We also demonstrate that the algorithm takes an almost linear time and hence it is computationally less expensive than what was possible so far.},

	Abstract = {A new clustering algorithm was developed that is able to group large data sets with more than 100,000 molecules according to their chemotypes. The algorithm preclusters a data set using a fingerprint version of the hierarchical k-means algorithm. Chemotypes are extracted from the terminal clusters via a maximum common substructure approach. Molecules forming a chemotype have to share a predefined number of rings, atoms, and non-carbon heavy atoms. In an iterative procedure, similar chemotypes and singletons are fused to larger chemotypes. Singletons that cannot be assigned to any chemotype are then grouped based on the proportion of overlap between the molecules. Representatives from each chemotype and the singletons are used in a second round of the hierarchical k-means algorithm to provide a final hierarchical grouping. Results are reported to an interactive graphical user interface which allows initial insights about the structure activity relationship (SAR) of the molecules. Example applications are shown for two chemotypes of reverse transcriptase inhibitors in the MDDR database and for the evaluation of descriptor-based similarity searching routines. A special focus was laid on the chemotype hopping potential of each individual routine. The algorithm will allow the analysis of high-throughput and virtual screening results with improved quality.},

	Abstract = {The Escherichia coli metabolome has been characterised using the two-dimensional structures of 745 metabolites, obtained from the EcoCyc and KEGG databases. Physicochemical properties of the metabolome have been calculated to provide an overview of this set of cognate ligands. A library of fragments commonly found among these molecules has been employed to reveal the main constituents of metabolites, and to assist a broad classification of the metabolome into biochemically relevant classes. Fragment-based fingerprints reveal the metabolome as a continuum in the two-dimensional structural space, where clusters of molecules sharing similar scaffolds can be identified, but are generally overlapping. Nucleotide, carbohydrate and amino acid-like molecules are the most prominent, but at high levels of similarity, a more detailed classification is possible. Classification schemes for the metabolome are a promising tool for understanding the chemical diversity of the metabolome. When used in conjunction with existing classifications of the proteome, they can help to elucidate the binding preferences and promiscuity of proteins and their cognate substrates.},

	Abstract = {The chemical space covered by compounds involved in metabolic reactions was compared with that of a random dataset of purchasable compounds by chemoinformatics techniques. The comparison was based on 3D structure, 2D structure, or descriptors of global properties, by means of self-organizing maps, random forests, and classification trees. The overlap between metabolites and non-metabolites was observed to be the least in the space defined by the global descriptors, the most discriminatory features being the number of OH groups, presence of aromatic systems, and molecular weight. Discrimination between the two datasets was achieved with accuracy up to 97%. Models were built to produce a metabolite-likeness parameter. A relationship between metabolite-likeness and ready biodegradability was observed.},

	Abstract = {`Inductive' QSAR descriptors have been used to develop the series of QSAR models enabling `in silico' distinguishing between antimicrobial compounds, conventional drugs, and druglike substances. The constructed neural network-based models operating by 30 `inductive' parameters have been validated on an extensive set of 2686 chemical structures and resulted in up to 97% accurate separation of the three types of molecular activities. The demonstrated ability of `inductive' parameters to adequately capture molecular features determining `antibiotic-like' and `druglike' potentials have been further utilized to construct a model of `Bacterial-Metabolite-Likeness' (BML). The same `inductive' descriptors have been used to train a neural network that could very accurately recognize substances involved into bacterial metabolism (that have been experimentally identified). When the developed model has been applied to the mixed set of antimicrobials, drugs, and druglike chemicals (not used for training the BML model), it exhibited a 2−5-fold recognition preference toward antimicrobial compounds compared to general drugs and an 18- to 45-fold preference when compared to a druglike substance (depending on the model stringency). These results illustrate immanent similarity between conventional antimicrobials and native bacterial metabolites and suggest that the developed BML model can be an effective classification tool for `in silico' antibiotic studies.},

	Abstract = {An acute toxicity model was constructed on the basis of experimental data for 685 chemicals tested for toxicity for fathead minnow. The multiple computer-automated structure evaluation (M-CASE) program was used for the construction of the model. Based on a comparison between our results and published results, we found that the methodology is able to describe acute toxicity for the fathead minnow with high accuracy. The model incorporates the concept of a baseline activity as one of the parameters for the correlation as well as others parameters such as the presence of biophores, hardness--softness parameters, and other characteristics determined from quantum mechanical calculations. By using its artificial intelligence algorithm, M-CASE chooses automatically the most suitable set of parameters for evaluating the minnow toxicity of any organic molecule. We found that M-CASE can correctly predict acute toxicity for minnow for 80% of organic compounds with an average error of only 0.4 log units of lethal dose. The main toxicophores, corresponding to polar narcosis and to other types of reactive chemicals, were identified.},

	Abstract = {In the field of aquatic toxicology, quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSARs) have developed as scientifically credible models for predicting the toxicity of chemicals when little or no empirical data are available. In recent years, there has been an evolution of QSAR development and application from that of a chemical-class perspective to one that is more consistent with assumptions regarding modes of toxic action. The objective of this research was to develop procedures that relate modes of acute toxic action in the fathead minnow (Pimephales promelas) to chemical structures and properties. An empirically derived database for diverse chemical structures of acute toxicity and corresponding modes of toxic action was developed through joint toxic action studies, the establishment of toxicodynamic profiles, and behavioral and dose-response interpretation of 96-h LC50 tests. Using the results from these efforts, as well as principles in the toxicological literature, approximately 600 chemicals were classified as narcotics (three distinct groups), oxidative phosphorylation uncouplers, respiratory inhibitors, electrophiles/proelectrophiles, acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, or central nervous system seizure agents. Using this data set, a computer-based expert system has been established whereby chemical structures are associated with likely modes of toxic action and, when available, corresponding QSARs.},

@article{Seidler:2003aa,
	Abstract = {Some small molecules, often hits from screening, form aggregates in solution that inhibit many enzymes. In contrast, drugs are thought to act specifically. To investigate this assumption, 50 unrelated drugs were tested for promiscuous inhibition via aggregation. Each drug was tested against three unrelated model enzymes: beta-lactamase, chymotrypsin, and malate dehydrogenase, none of which are considered targets of these drugs. To be judged promiscuous, the drugs had to inhibit all three enzymes, do so in a time-dependent manner, be sensitive to detergent and to enzyme concentration, and form particles detectable by light scattering. Of the 50 drugs tested, 43 were nonpromiscuous by these criteria. Surprisingly, four of the drugs showed promiscuous, aggregation-based inhibition at concentrations below 100 muM: clotrimazole, benzyl benzoate, nicardipine, and delavirdine. Three other drugs also behaved as aggregation-based inhibitors, but only at high concentrations (about 400 muM). To investigate possible structure-activity relationships among promiscuous drugs, five analogues of the antifungal clotrimazole were studied. Three of these, miconazole, econazole, and sulconazole, were promiscuous but the other two, fluconazole and ketoconazole, were not. Using recursive partitioning, these experimental results were used to develop a model for predicting aggregate-based promiscuity. This model correctly classified 94\% of Ill compounds-47 aggregators and 64 nonaggregators-that have been studied for this effect. To evaluate the model, it was used to predict the behavior of 75 drugs not previously investigated for aggregation. Several preliminary points emerge. Most drugs are not promiscuous, even at high concentrations. Nevertheless, at high enough concentrations (20-400 muM), some drugs can aggregate and act promiscuously, suggesting that aggregation may be common among small molecules at micromolar concentrations, at least in biochemical buffers.},

@article{Hermann:2006aa,
	Abstract = {With the emergence of sequences and even structures for proteins of unknown function, structure-based prediction of enzyme activity has become a pragmatic as well as an interesting question. Here we investigate a method to predict substrates for enzymes of known structure by docking high-energy intermediate forms of the potential substrates. A database of such high-energy transition-state analogues was created from the KEGG metabolites. To reduce the number of possible reactions to consider, we restricted ourselves to enzymes of the amidohydrolase superfamily. We docked each metabolite into seven different amidohydrolases in both the ground-state and the high-energy intermediate forms. Docking the high-energy intermediates improved the discrimination between decoys and substrates significantly over the corresponding standard ground-state database, both by enrichment of the true substrates and by geometric fidelity. To test this method prospectively, we attempted to predict the enantioselectivity of a set of chiral substrates for phosphotriesterase, for both wild-type and mutant forms of this enzyme. The stereoselectivity ratios of the six enzymes considered for those four substrate enantiomer pairs differed over a range of 10- to 10 000-fold and underwent 20 switches in stereoselectivities for favored enantiomers, compared to the wild type. The docking of the high-energy intermediates correctly predicted the stereoselectivities for 18 of the 20 substrate/enzyme combinations when compared to subsequent experimental synthesis and testing. The possible applications of this approach to other enzymes are considered.},

The model correctly predicted 27 compounds, and most of the active derivatives showed IC50 values in the μM−nM range against both the MAO-A and MAO-B isoforms. Compound 14 shows the same MAO-A inhibitory activity (IC50 = 7.2 nM), as clorgyline used as a reference inhibitor and has the highest MAO-A specificity (1000-fold higher compared to MAO-B). On the other hand, compounds 24 (IC50 = 1.2 nM) and 28 (IC50 = 1.5 nM) show higher activity than selegiline (IC50 = 19.6 nM) and high MAO-B selectivity with 100-fold and 1600-fold inhibition levels, with respect to the MAO-A isoform.},

@article{Strombergsson:2008aa,
	Abstract = {Chemogenomics is a new strategy in in silico drug discovery, where the ultimate goal is to understand molecular recognition for all molecules interacting with all proteins in the proteome. To study such cross interactions, methods that can generalize over proteins that vary greatly in sequence, structure, and function are needed. We present a general quantitative approach to protein−ligand binding affinity prediction that spans the entire structural enzyme-ligand space. The model was trained on a data set composed of all available enzymes cocrystallized with druglike ligands, taken from four publicly available interaction databases, for which a crystal structure is available. Each enzyme was characterized by a set of local descriptors of protein structure that describe the binding site of the cocrystallized ligand. The ligands in the training set were described by traditional QSAR descriptors. To evaluate the model, a comprehensive test set consisting of enzyme structures and ligands was manually curated. The test set contained enzyme-ligand complexes for which no crystal structures were available, and thus the binding modes were unknown. The test set enzymes were therefore characterized by matching their entire structures to the local descriptor library constructed from the training set. Both the training and the test set contained enzyme-ligand complexes from all major enzyme classes, and the enzymes spanned a large range of sequences and folds. The experimental binding affinities (pKi) ranged from 0.5 to 11.9 (0.7−11.0 in the test set). The induced model predicted the binding affinities of the external test set enzyme-ligand complexes with an r2 of 0.53 and an RMSEP of 1.5. This demonstrates that the use of local descriptors makes it possible to create rough predictive models that can generalize over a wide range of protein targets.},

	Abstract = {Many surface proteins of Gram-positive bacteria, which play important roles during the pathogenesis of human infections, are anchored to the cell wall envelope by a mechanism requiring sortases. Sortase B, a cysteine transpeptidase from Staphylococcus aureus, cleaves the C-terminal sorting signal of IsdC at the NPQTN motif and tethers the polypeptide to the pentaglycine cell wall cross-bridge. During catalysis, the active site cysteine of sortase and the cleaved substrate form an acyl intermediate, which is then resolved by the amino group of pentaglycine cross-bridges. We report here the crystal structures of SrtBΔN30 in complex with two active site inhibitors, MTSET and E64, and with the cell wall substrate analog tripleglycine. These structures reveal, for the first time, the active site disposition and the unique Cys-Arg catalytic machinery of the cysteine transpeptidase, and they also provide useful information for the future design of anti-infective agents against sortases.},

	Abstract = {A multiple criteria approach is presented, that is used to perform a comparative analysis of four recently developed combinatorial libraries to drugs, Molecular Libraries Small Molecule Repository (MLSMR) and natural products. The compound databases were assessed in terms of physicochemical properties, scaffolds, and fingerprints. The approach enables the analysis of property space coverage, degree of overlap between collections, scaffold and structural diversity, and overall structural novelty. The degree of overlap between combinatorial libraries and drugs was assessed using the R-NN curve methodology, which measures the density of chemical space around a query molecule embedded in the chemical space of a target collection. The combinatorial libraries studied in this work exhibit scaffolds that were not observed in the drug, MLSMR, and natural products databases. The fingerprint-based comparisons indicate that these combinatorial libraries are structurally different than current drugs. The R-NN curve methodology revealed that a proportion of molecules in the combinatorial libraries is located within the property space of the drugs. However, the R-NN analysis also showed that there are a significant number of molecules in several combinatorial libraries that are located in sparse regions of the drug space.},

	Abstract = {In recent years, there has been an explosion in the availability of publicly accessible chemical information, including chemical structures of small molecules, structure-derived properties and associated biological activities in a variety of assays. These data sources present us with a significant opportunity to develop and apply computational tools to extract and understand the underlying structure-activity relationships. Furthermore, by integrating chemical data sources with biological information (protein structure, gene expression and so on), we can attempt to build up a holistic view  of the effects of small molecules in biological systems. Equally important is the ability for non-experts  to access and utilize state of the art cheminformatics method and models. In this review we present  recent developments in cheminformatics methodologies and infrastructure that provide a robust,  distributed approach to mining large and complex chemical datasets. In the area of methodology  development, we highlight recent work on characterizing structure-activity landscapes, QSAR model  domain applicability and the use of chemical similarity in text mining. In the area of infrastructure, we  discuss a distributed web services framework that allows easy deployment and uniform access to 
computational (statistics, cheminformatics and computational chemistry) methods, data and models.  We also discuss the development of PubChem derived databases and highlight techniques that allow  us to scale the infrastructure to extremely large compound collections, by use of distributed processing  on Grids. Given that the above work is applicable to arbitrary types of cheminformatics problems, we  also present some case studies related to virtual screening for anti-malarials and predictions of anti-  cancer activity.},

	Abstract = {Latent variable models represent the probability density of data in a space of several dimensions in terms of a smaller number of latent, or hidden, variables. A familiar example is factor analysis, which is based on a linear transformation between the latent space and the data space. In this article, we introduce a form of nonlinear latent variable model tailed the generative topographic mapping, for which the parameters of the model can be determined using the expectation-maximization algorithm. GTM provides a principled alternative to the widely used self-organizing map (SOM) of Kohonen (1982) and overcomes most of the significant limitations of the SOM. We demonstrate the performance of the GTM algorithm on a toy problem and on simulated data from now diagnostics for a multiphase oil pipeline.},

	Abstract = {The deterministic annealing approach to clustering and its extensions has, demonstrated substantial performance improvement over standard supervised and unsupervised learning methods in a variety of important applications including compression, estimation, pattern recognition and classification and statistical regression. The method offers three important features: 1) the ability to avoid many poor local optima; 2) applicability to many different structures/architectures; and 3) the ability to minimize the right cost function even when its gradients vanish almost everywhere, as in the case of the empirical classification error It is derived within a probabilistic framework from basic information theoretic principles (e.g., maximum entropy and random coding). The application-specific cost is minimized subject to a constraint on the randomness (Shannon entropy) of the solution, which is,gradually lowered. We emphasize intuition gained from analogy to statistical physics, where this is an annealing process that avoids many shallow local minima of the specified cost and, at the limit of zero "temperature," produces a nonrandom (hard) solution. Alternatively, the method is derived within rate-distortion theory, where the annealing process is equivalent to computation of Shannon's rate-distortion function, and the annealing temperature is inversely proportional to the slope of the curve. This provides new insights into the method and its performance, as well as new insights into rate-distortion theory itself. The basic algorithm is extended by incorporating structural constraints to allow optimization of numerous popular structures including vector quantizers, decision trees, multilayer perceptrons, radial basis functions, and mixtures of experts. Experimental results show considerable performance gains over standard structure-specific and application-specific training methods. The paper concludes with a brief discussion of extensions of the method that are currently under investigation.},

The dataset also contains the experimental conditions that were used to carry out the ITC experiments. The chemical structures of the ligands are also provided. Analysis of the data confirms the existence of enthalpy-entropy compensation effect for the first time using strictly ITC data.},

The absence of sufficient high-quality metadata prevents intelligent computer access to the data without human intervention. This creates barriers to the automation of data mining in activities such as quantitative structure-activity relationship modelling. The application of Semantic Web technologies to chemical data is shown to reduce these limitations.

	Abstract = {Methods that rapidly evaluate molecular complexity and synthetic feasibility are becoming increasingly important for in silico chemistry. We propose a new metric based on relative atomic electronegativities and bond parameters that evaluate both synthetic and molecular complexity (SMCM) starting from chemical structures. Against molecular weight, SMCM has the lowest fraction of adjusted variance (R-2=0.535) on a series of 261048 diverse compounds, when compared to the complexity metric of Baron and Chanon (R-2=0.777; J. Chem. Inf. Comput. Sci. 2001, 41, 269-272) and Rucker (R-2=0.895 for log complexity values; J. Chem. Inf. Comput. Sci. 2004, 44, 378-386), respectively. These metrics are in general agreement when the metabolic synthesis of cholesterol from S-3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl coenzyme A is monitored, indicating that SMCM can be useful in discerning increases in complexity. Because the presence of substructure patterns can be directly incorporated into this scheme, SMCM is relatively straightforward and can be easily tailored to rapidly evaluate virtual (combinatorial) libraries and high throughput screening hits.},

	Abstract = {The dominant paradigm in drug discovery is the concept of designing maximally selective ligands to act on individual drug targets. However, many effective drugs act via modulation of multiple proteins rather than single targets. Advances in systems biology are revealing a phenotypic robustness and a network structure that strongly suggests that exquisitely selective compounds, compared with multitarget drugs, may exhibit lower than desired clinical efficacy. This new appreciation of the role of polypharmacology has significant implications for tackling the two major sources of attrition in drug development---efficacy and toxicity. Integrating network biology and polypharmacology holds the promise of expanding the current opportunity space for druggable targets. However, the rational design of polypharmacology faces considerable challenges in the need for new methods to validate target combinations and optimize multiple structure-activity relationships while maintaining drug-like properties. Advances in these areas are creating the foundation of the next paradigm in drug discovery: network pharmacology.},

The proposed set of radii therefore fills most of the gaps and solves some inconsistencies in currently used covalent radii. The transition metal and lanthanide contractions as well as the differences in covalent atomic radii between low spin and high spin configurations in transition metals are illustrated by the proposed radii set.},

@article{Godden:2005aa,
	Abstract = {Similarity searching using molecular fingerprints is a widely used approach for the identification of novel hits. A fingerprint search involves many pairwise comparisons of bit string representations of known active molecules with those precomputed for database compounds. Bit string overlap, as evaluated by various similarity metrics, is used as a measure of molecular similarity. Results of a number of studies focusing on fingerprints suggest that it is difficult, if not impossible, to develop generally applicable search parameters and strategies, irrespective of the compound classes under investigation. Rather, more or less, each individual search problem requires an adjustment of calculation conditions. Thus, there is a need for diagnostic tools to analyze fingerprint-based similarity searching. We report an analysis of fingerprint search calculations on different sets of structurally diverse active compounds. Calculations on five biological activity classes were carried out with two fingerprints in two compound Source databases, and the results were analyzed in histograms. Tanimoto coefficient (Tc) value ranges where active compounds were detected were compared to the distribution of Tc values in the database. The analysis revealed that compound class-specific effects strongly influenced the outcome of these fingerprint calculations. Among the five diverse compound sets studied, very different search results were obtained. The analysis described here can be applied to determine Tc intervals where scaffold hopping Occurs. It can also be used to benchmark fingerprint calculations or estimate their probability of success.},

Tools for exploiting protein structures or sets of ligands known to bind particular targets can be used for binding-mode prediction, virtual screening, and prediction of activity. A serious weakness within the field is a lack of standards with respect to quantitative evaluation of methods, data set preparation, and data set sharing. Our goal should be to report new methods or comparative evaluations of methods in a manner that supports decision making for practical applications. Here we propose a modest beginning, with recommendations for requirements on statistical reporting, requirements for data sharing, and best practices for benchmark preparation and usage.},

We have expanded the data set by adding a number of nonsteroidal SHBG ligands identified both from the literature and in our previous experimental studies.This updated molecular set has been used herein to develop 4D QSAR models based on "inductive" descriptors and to gain insight into the molecular basis of protein-ligand interactions. Molecular alignment was generated by means of docking active Compounds into the active site of the SHBG. alin Surprisingly, the alignment of the benchmark steroids contradicted the classical ligand-based alignment utilized in previous CoMFA and CoMSIA models yet afforded models with higher statistical significance and predictive power. The resulting QSAR models combined with CoMFA and CoMSiA models as well as structure-based virtual screening allowed discovering several low-micromolar to nanomolar nonsteroidal inhibitors for human SHBG.},

	Abstract = {Refined nearest neighbor analysis was recently introduced for the analysis of virtual screening benchmark data sets. It constitutes a technique from the field of spatial statistics and provides a mathematical framework for the nonparametric analysis of mapped point patterns. Here, refined nearest neighbor analysis is used to design benchmark data sets for virtual screening based on PubChem bioactivity data. A workflow is devised that purges data sets of compounds active against pharmaceutically relevant targets from unselective hits. Topological optimization using experimental design strategies monitored by refined nearest neighbor analysis functions is applied to generate corresponding data sets of actives and decoys that are unbiased with regard to analogue bias and artificial enrichment. These data sets provide a tool for Maximum Unbiased Validation (MUV) of virtual screening methods. The data sets and a software package implementing the MUV design workflow are freely available at http://www.pharmchem.tu-bs.de/lehre/baumann/MUV.html.},

	Abstract = {Abstract: This study addresses a number of topical issues around the use of protein-ligand docking in virtual screening. We show that, for the validation of such methods, it is key to use focused libraries (containing compounds with one-dimensional properties, similar to the actives), rather than "random" or "drug-like" libraries to test the actives against. We also show that, to obtain good enrichments, the docking program needs to produce reliable binding modes. We demonstrate how pharmacophores can be used to guide the dockings and improve enrichments, and we compare the performance of three consensus-ranking protocols against ranking based on individual scoring functions. Finally, we show that protein-ligand docking can be an effective aid in the screening for weak, fragment-like binders, which has rapidly become a popular strategy for hit identification. All results presented are based on carefully constructed virtual screening experiments against four targets, using the protein-ligand docking program GOLD.},

	Abstract = {Two modifications to the standard use of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves for evaluating virtual screening methods are proposed. The first is to replace the linear plots usually used with semi-logarithmic ones (pROC plots), including when doing ``area under the curve'' (AUC) calculations. Doing so is a simple way to bias the statistic to favor identification of ``hits'' early in the recovery curve rather than late. A second suggested modification entails weighting each active based on the size of the lead series to which it belongs. Two weighting schemes are described: arithmetic, in which the weight for each active is inversely proportional to the size of the cluster from which it comes; and harmonic, in which weights are inversely proportional to the rank of each active within its class. Either scheme is able to distinguish biased from unbiased screening statistics, but the harmonically weighted AUC in particular emphasizes the ability to place representatives of each class of active early in the recovery curve.},

	Abstract = {With the growth of interest in database searching and compound selection, the quantification of chemical similarity has become an area of intense practical and theoretical interest. One of the most widely used methods of measuring chemical similarity is based on mapping fragments within a molecule as bits within a binary string. We present empirical results which suggest that bit strings provide a nonintuitive encoding of molecular size, shape, and global similarity. Other results, this time statistical in nature, suggest that the observed behavior of bit string-based searches have a large nonspecific component. On this basis, we question whether bit string-based similarity methods possess all the features desirable in a quantitative chemical distance measure or metric and suggest that there are instances when they may not be the most appropriate tool for searching or segregating chemical structures.},

	Abstract = {RNA interference (RNAi) is a powerful toot to study gene function in cultured cells. Transfected cell microarrays in principle allow high-throughput phenotypic analysis after gene knockdown by microscopy. But bottlenecks in imaging and data analysis have limited such high-content screens to endpoint assays in fixed cells and determination of global parameters such as viability. Here we have overcome these limitations and developed an automated platform for high-content RNAi screening by time-lapse fluorescence microscopy of Live HeLa cells expressing histone-GFP to report on chromosome segregation and structure. We automated all steps, including printing transfection-ready small. interfering RNA (siRNA) microarrays, fluorescence imaging and computational phenotyping of digital images, in a high-throughput workflow. We validated this method in a pilot screen assaying cell division and delivered a sensitive, time-resolved phenoprint for each of the 49 endogenous genes we suppressed. This modular platform is scalable and makes the power of time-lapse microscopy available for genome-wide RNAi screens.},

	Abstract = {Determination of molecular similarity plays an important role in analyzing large compound databases in chemical and pharmaceutical research. When molecules are described by binary vectors with bits corresponding to the presence or absence of structural features, the Tanimoto association coefficient is the most commonly used measure of similarity or chemical distance between two compounds. However, when used to select compounds for an optimal spread design, the Tanimoto coefficient produces an intrinsic bias toward smaller compounds. We have developed a new association coefficient that overcomes this bias. This article gives details of the new coefficient and contrasts the two coefficients for selecting diverse sets of compounds from a large collection. When the Tanimoto coefficient is modified as suggested to select a diverse set in the National Cancer Institute and Registry of Toxic Effects of Chemical Substances databases, the average number of features among the selected compounds increases by more than 50%. },

	Abstract = {This work describes a practical strategy used at Pharmacia for identifying compounds for follow-up screening following an initial HTS campaign against targets where no 3-D structural information is available and preliminary SAR models do not exist. The approach explicitly takes into account different representations of chemistry space and identifies compounds for follow-up screening that are likely to provide the best overall coverage of the chemistry spaces considered. Specifically, the work employs hit-directed nearest-neighbor (HDNN) searching of compound databases based upon a set of "probe compounds" obtained as hits in the preliminary high-throughput screens. Four different molecular representations that generate nearly unique chemistry spaces are used. The representations include 3-D, 2-D, 2-D topological BCUTs (2-DT) and molecular fingerprints derived from substructural fragments. In the case of the BCUT representations the NN searching is distance based, while in the case of molecular fingerprints a similarity-based measure is used. Generally, the results obtained differ significantly among all four methods, that is, the sets of NN compounds have surprisingly little overlap. Moreover, in all of the four chemistry space representations, a minimum of 3- to 4-fold enrichment in actives over random screening is observed even though the actives identified in each of the sets of NNs are in large measure unique. These results suggest that use of multiple searches based upon a variety of molecular representations provides an effective way of identifying more hits in HDNN searches of chemistry spaces than can be realized with single searches. },

	Abstract = {Fingerprints are molecular bit string representations and are among the most popular descriptors for similarity  searching. In key-type fingerprints, each bit position monitors the presence or absence of a prespecified  chemical or structural feature. In contrast to hashed fingerprints, this keyed design makes it possible to  evaluate individual bit positions and the associated structural features during similarity searching. Bit silencing 
is introduced as a systematic approach to assess the contribution of each bit in a fingerprint to similarity  search performance. From the resulting bit contribution profile, a bit position-dependent weight vector is  derived that determines the relative weight of each bit on the basis of its individual contribution. By merging  this weight vector with the Tanimoto coefficient, compound class-directed similarity metrics are obtained  that further increase fingerprint search calculations compared to conventional calculations of Tanimoto similarity. },

	Abstract = {Abstract: Hormone sensitive lipase (HSL) has been recently implicated in diabetes and obesity, prompting attempts to discover new HSL inhibitors. Toward this end, we explored the pharmacophoric space of HSL inhibitors using four diverse sets of compounds. Subsequently, genetic algorithm and multiple linear regression analysis were employed to select optimal combination of pharmacophoric models and 2D physicochemical descriptors capable of yielding a self-consistent and predictive quantitative structureactivity relationship (QSAR) (r = 0.822, n = 99, F = 11.1, rLOO2 = 0.521, rPRESS2 against 23 external test inhibitors = 0.522). Interestingly, two pharmacophoric models emerged in the QSAR equation suggesting at least two binding modes. These pharmacophores were employed to screen the National Cancer Institute (NCI) list of compounds and our in-house built database of established drugs and agrochemicals. Active hits included the safe herbicidal agent bifenox (IC50 = 0.43 ºM) and the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory naproxen (IC50 = 1.20 ºM). Our active hits undermined the traditional believe that HSL inhibitors should possess covalent bond-forming groups.},

@article{Veber:2002aa,
	Abstract = {Oral bioavailability measurements in rats for over 1100 drug candidates studied at SmithKline Beecham Pharmaceuticals (now GlaxoSmithKline) have allowed us to analyze the relative importance of molecular properties considered to influence that drug property. Reduced molecular flexibility, as measured by the number of rotatable bonds, and low polar surface area or total hydrogen bond count (sum of donors and acceptors) are found to be important predictors of good oral bioavailability, independent of molecular weight. That on average both the number of rotatable bonds and polar surface area or hydrogen bond count tend to increase with molecular weight may in part explain the success of the molecular weight parameter in predicting oral bioavailability. The commonly applied molecular weight cutoff at 500 does not itself significantly separate compounds with poor oral bioavailability from those with acceptable values in this extensive data set. Our observations suggest that compounds which meet only the two criteria of (1) 10 or fewer rotatable bonds and (2) polar surface area equal to or less than 140 Angstrom(2) (or 12 or fewer H-bond donors and acceptors) will have a high probability of good oral bioavailability in the rat. Data sets for the artificial membrane permeation rate and for clearance in the rat were also examined. Reduced polar surface area correlates better with increased permeation rate than does lipophilicity (C log P), and increased rotatable bond count has a negative effect on the permeation rate. A threshold permeation rate is a prerequisite of oral bioavailability. The rotatable bond count does not correlate with the data examined here for the in vivo clearance rate in the rat.},

	Abstract = {With the burgeoning immunological data in the scientific literature, scientists must increasingly rely on Internet resources to inform and enhance their work. Here we provide a brief overview of the adaptive immune response and summaries of immunoinformatics resources, emphasizing those with Web interfaces. These resources include searchable databases of epitopes and immune-related molecules, and analysis tools for T cell and B cell epitope prediction, vaccine design, and protein structure comparisons. There is an agreeable synergy between the growing collections in immune-related databases and the growing sophistication of analysis software; the databases provide the foundation for developing predictive computational tools, which in turn enable more rapid identification of immune responses to populate the databases. Collectively, these resources contribute to improved understanding of immune responses and escape, and evolution of pathogens under immune pressure. The public health implications are vast, including designing vaccines, understanding autoimmune diseases, and defining the correlates of immune protection.},

We experimentally tested 20 of these unexpected drug-drug relations and validated 13 implied drug-target relations by in vitro binding assays, of which 11 reveal inhibition constants equal to less than 10 micromolar. Nine of these were tested and confirmed in cell assays, documenting the feasibility of using phenotypic information to infer molecular interactions and hinting at new uses of marketed drugs.},

	Abstract = {Abstract: The study of structureactivity relationships (SARs) of small molecules is of fundamental importance in medicinal chemistry and drug design. Here, we introduce an approach that combines the analysis of similarity-based molecular networks and SAR index distributions to identify multiple SAR components present within sets of active compounds. Different compound classes produce molecular networks of distinct topology. Subsets of compounds related by different local SARs are often organized in small communities in networks annotated with potency information. Many local SAR communities are not isolated but connected by chemical bridges, i.e., similar molecules occurring in different local SAR contexts. The analysis makes it possible to relate local and global SAR features to each other and identify key compounds that are major determinants of SAR characteristics. In many instances, such compounds represent start and end points of chemical optimization pathways and aid in the selection of other candidates from their communities.},

@article{Radhakrishnan:2008aa,
	Abstract = {Drug resistance is a significant obstacle in the effective treatment of diseases with rapidly mutating targets, such as AIDS, malaria, and certain forms of cancer. Such targets are remarkably efficient at exploring the space of functional mutants and at evolving to evade drug binding while still maintaining their biological role. To overcome this challenge, drug regimens must be active against potential target variants. Such a goal may be accomplished by one drug molecule that recognizes multiple variants or by a drug "cocktail"-a small collection of drug molecules that collectively binds all desired variants. Ideally, one wants the smallest cocktail possible due to the potential for increased toxicity with each additional drug. Therefore, the task of designing a regimen for multiple target variants can be framed as an optimization problem-find the smallest collection of molecules that together "covers" the relevant target variants. In this work, we formulate and apply this optimization framework to theoretical model target ensembles. These results are analyzed to develop an understanding of how the physical properties of a target ensemble relate to the properties of the optimal cocktail. We focus on electrostatic variation within target ensembles, as it is one important mechanism by which drug resistance is achieved. Using integer programming, we systematically designed optimal cocktails to cover model target ensembles. We found that certain drug molecules covered much larger regions of target space than others, a phenomenon explained by theory grounded in continuum electrostatics. Molecules within optimal cocktails were often dissimilar, such that each drug was responsible for binding variants with a certain electrostatic property in common. On average, the number of molecules in the optimal cocktails correlated with the number of variants, the differences in the variants' electrostatic properties at the binding interface, and the level of binding affinity required. We also treated cases in which a subset of target variants was to be avoided, modeling the common challenge of closely related host molecules that may be implicated in drug toxicity. Such decoys generally increased the size of the required cocktail and more often resulted in infeasible optimizations. Taken together, this work provides practical optimization methods for the design of drug cocktails and a theoretical, physics-based framework through which useful insights can be achieved.},

@article{Richmond:2006aa,
	Abstract = {Alignment of multiple ligands based on shared pharmacophoric and pharmacosteric features is a long-recognized challenge in drug discovery and development. This is particularly true when the spatial overlap between structures is incomplete, in which case no good template molecule is likely to exist. Pair-wise rigid ligand alignment based on linear assignment (the LAMDA algorithm) has the potential to address this problem (Richmond et al. in J Mol Graph Model 23:199-209, 2004). Here we present the version of LAMDA embodied in the GALAHAD program, which carries out multi-way alignments by iterative construction of hypermolecules that retain the aggregate as well as the individual attributes of the ligands. We have also generalized the cost function from being purely atom-based to being one that operates on ionic, hydrogen bonding, hydrophobic and steric features. Finally, we have added the ability to generate useful partial-match 3D search queries from the hypermolecules obtained. By running frozen conformations through the GALAHAD program, one can utilize the extended version of LAMDA to generate pharmacophores and pharmacosteres that agree well with crystal structure alignments for a range of literature datasets, with minor adjustments of the default parameters generating even better models. Allowing for inclusion of partial match constraints in the queries yields pharmacophores that are consistently a superset of full-match pharmacophores identified in previous analyses, with the additional features representing points of potentially beneficial interaction with the target.},

	Abstract = {A series of dihydro-alkylthio-benzyl-oxopyrimidines (S-DABOs) bearing a 2-aryl-2-oxoethylsulfanyl chain at pyrimidine C2, an alkyl group at C5, and a 2,6-dichloro-, 2-chloro-6-fluoro-, and 2,6-difluoro-benzyl substitution at C6 (oxophenethyl-S-DABOs, 6-8) is here described. The new compounds showed low micromolar to low nanomolar (in one case subnanomolar) inhibitory activity against wt HIV-1. Against clinically relevant HIV-1 mutants (K103N, Y181C, and Y188L) as well as in enzyme (wt and K103N, Y181I, and L1001 mutated RTs) assays, compounds carrying an ethylliso-propyl group at C5 and a 2,6-dichloro-/2-chloro-6-fluoro-benzyl moiety at C6 were the most potent derivatives, also characterized by low fold resistance ratio. Interestingly, the structure-activity relationship (SAR) data drawn from this DABO series are more related to HEPT than to DABO derivatives. These findings were at least in part rationalized by the description of a fair superimposition between the 6-8 and TNK-651 (a HEPT analogue) binding modes in both WT and Y181C RTs.},

In addition, we highlight the quantification of structure-based diversity using site-derived fingerprints, and review virtual screening methods using both single refined hypotheses and the fingerprints of multiple potential hypotheses. Further, we discuss methods that take protein flexibility and molecular shape-into account.},

	Abstract = {We present a Java applet, based on the open source Jmol program, which allows the calculation of coupling constants and NOEs from a three-dimensional structure. The program has all the viewing features of Jmol, but adds the capability to calculate both H-H and H-C 3-bond couplings constants. In the case of H-H couplings, the Altona equation is used to perform this. The program also calculates NOES using the full relaxation matrix approach. All these calculations are driven from a simple point and click interface. The program can calculate values for multi-structure files, and can produce input files for the conformational fitting program NAMFIS. Copyright (c) 2007 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

	Abstract = {In this paper, we present a new algorithm for automated drawing of 2D structural formulas of molecules. The algorithm is based on the classical scheme of a drawing queue placing the molecular fragments in a sequential way. We extend the concept of so-called prefabricated units developed for complex ring systems to automatically created drawing units for chains and rings which will then be assembled in a sequential fashion. The approach is fast and can be naturally extended to the problem of drawing molecules with common core structures. Further on, we present an algorithm that allows the drawing of 2D structural formulas under directional constraints assigned to a subset of bonds. Since no numerical optimization is necessary, the algorithm creates drawings of small organic molecules on the order of 500 structures per second. The new algorithm is relevant for all kinds of prediction and analysis software presenting a large number of probably similar molecular structures to the user of the software.},

@article{Fechner:2007aa,
	Abstract = {We implemented a fragment-based de novo design algorithm for a population-based optimization of molecular structures. The concept is grounded on an evolution strategy with mutation and crossover operators for structure breeding. Molecular building blocks were obtained from the pseudo-retrosynthesis of a collection of pharmacologically active compounds following the RECAP principle. The influence of mutation and crossover on the course of optimization was assessed in redesign studies using known drugs as template structures. A topological atom-pair descriptor grounded on potential pharmacophore points was used as a molecular descriptor, and the Manhattan distance between the template and candidate molecules served as a fitness function. Exclusive use of the crossover operator yielded few unique compounds and often resulted in premature convergence of the optimization process, whereas exclusive use of the mutation operator resulted in diverse high-quality structures. Combinations of crossover and mutation yielded the overall best results. The majority of the designed structures exhibit a chemically reasonable architecture; chiral centers are rare, and unfavorable connections of building blocks are infrequent. We conclude that this fragment-based design principle is suited as an idea generator for the automated design of novel leadlike molecules.},

	Abstract = {A representation of molecular structure has been devised for application in computer-assisted synthesis design systems and chemical information storage and retrieval systems. It takes into account constitution, configuration, and conformation. Constitution is described in terms of unshared valence electrons and ''bonding systems''. The latter comprise all pairwise bonding relations between the atoms of a chemical structure. Bonding relations arising from both valence electron sharing and electrostatic interaction are accounted for. Stereochemistry is treated on an ''approximate-geometrical'' level: Instead of exact bond angles and lengths only the relative spatial arrangement of atoms is taken into consideration. Thus, our molecular structure representation can be regarded as the computer-oriented counterpart of the graphical representation via structural formulas.},

	Abstract = {Axially chiral natural products are rewarding synthetic targets, due to their wide distribution, diverse structures, and promising bioactivities. The "lactone concept" provides an efficient strategy for the regio- and stereoselective construction of even bulky biaryls. Key steps are the intramolecular coupling of the ester-prefixed molecular portions to give (mostly configurationally unstable) biaryl lactones and their stereoselective ring cleavage (usually by dynamic kinetic resolution), leading to the one or-optionally-the other atropisomeric product from. the same lactone. Stereoisomeric byproducts can be recycled by recyclization back to the lactone. The broad applicability of the method is demonstrated in the total synthesis of selected representatives from five very different classes of natural biaryl products.},

	Abstract = {Ring information is a large part of the structural topology used to identify and characterize molecular structures. It is hence of crucial importance to obtain this information for a variety of tasks in computational chemistry. Many different approaches for "ring perception", i.e., the extraction of cycles from a molecular Graph, have been described. The chemistry literature on this topic, however, reports a surprisingly large number of incorrect statements about the properties of chemically relevant ring sets and, in particular, about the mutual relationships of different sets of cycles in a graph. In part these problems seem to have arisen from a sometimes rather idiosyncratic terminology for notions that are fairly standard in graph theory. In this contribution we translate the definitions of concepts such as the Smallest Set of Smallest Rings, Essential Set of Essential Rings, Extended Set of Smallest Rings, Set of Smallest Cycles at Edges, Set of Elementary Ring, K-rings, and beta-rings into a more widely used mathematical language. We then outline the basic properties of different cycle sets and provide numerous counterexamples to incorrect claims in the published literature. These counterexamples may have a serious practical impact because at least some of them are molecular graphs of well-known molecules. As a consequence, we propose a catalog of desirable properties for chemically useful sets of rings.},

	Abstract = {PATTY (Programmable ATom TYper) is an algorithm for assigning ''atom types'' to a molecule based on its connection table of atoms and bonds. Its operation is controlled entirely by a rules file created by the user. Each rule contains a ''pattern'', a description in linear notation of a class of chemical substructures which may contain branches or rings. Rules are of two sorts: those which define properties to be used in subsequent rules and those which assign the final atom types. As an example, we present rules for classifying atoms into seven broad types based on their physical properties (e.g. cation, H-bond donor, hydrophobe). This classification has been applied to large databases of three-dimensional modes of druglike compounds. PATTY is very rapid and operates on a variety of hardware platforms.},

@article{Hermann:2007aa,
	Abstract = {With many genomes sequenced, a pressing challenge in biology is predicting the function of the proteins that the genes encode. When proteins are unrelated to others of known activity, bioinformatics inference for function becomes problematic. It would thus be useful to interrogate protein structures for function directly. Here, we predict the function of an enzyme of unknown activity, Tm0936 from Thermotoga maritima, by docking high- energy intermediate forms of thousands of candidate metabolites. The docking hit list was dominated by adenine analogues, which appeared to undergo C6- deamination. Four of these, including 5- methylthioadenosine and S- adenosylhomocysteine ( SAH), were tested as substrates, and three had substantial catalytic rate constants ( 10(5) M-1 s(-1)). The X- ray crystal structure of the complex between Tm0936 and the product resulting from the deamination of SAH, S- inosylhomocysteine, was determined, and it corresponded closely to the predicted structure. The deaminated products can be further metabolized by T. maritima in a previously uncharacterized SAH degradation pathway. Structure- based docking with high- energy forms of potential substrates may be a useful tool to annotate enzymes for function.},

@article{Chennubhotla:2005aa,
	Abstract = {With advances in structure genomics, it is now recognized that knowledge of structure alone is insufficient to understand and control the mechanisms of biomolecular function. Additional information in the form of dynamics is needed. As demonstrated in a large number of studies, the machinery of proteins and their complexes can be understood to a good approximation by adopting Gaussian (or elastic) network models (GNM) for simplified normal mode analyses. While this approximation lacks chemical details, it provides us with a means for assessing the collective motions of large structures/assemblies and perform a comparative analysis of a series of proteins, thus providing insights into the mechanical aspects of biomolecular dynamics. In this paper, we discuss recent applications of GNM to a series of enzymes as well as large structures such as the HK97 bacteriophage viral capsids. Understanding the dynamics of large protein structures can be computationally challenging. To this end, we introduce a new approach for building a hierarchical, reduced rank representation of the protein topology and consequently the fluctuation dynamics.},

The Markush representation used is described, along with the way in which it can be built from a reaction- and precursor-based description of a library. The process used to generate SMILES, and structure fingerprint and calculated property descriptors for each specific molecule in the library is discussed. Comparative performance figures are given for the Markush approach and various standard fingerprint generation programs based on the enumerated members of the library; the former shows time savings of a couple of orders of magnitude. The use of these rapidly generated fingerprints for clustering of large combinatorial libraries is described. (C) 2000 by Elsevier Science Inc.},

@article{Brown:2006ac,
	Abstract = {The molecular scaffold is an oft-cited concept in medicinal chemistry suggesting that the definition of what makes a scaffold is rigorous and objective. However, this is far from the case with the definition of a scaffold being highly dependent on the particular viewpoint of a given scientist. It follows, therefore, that the definition of scaffold hopping and, more importantly, the detection of what constitutes a scaffold hop, is also ill-defined and highly subjective.

Essentially, it is agreed that scaffolds. should be substantially different from each other, although significantly similar to each other, to constitute a hop. In the latter, the scaffolds must permit a similar geometric arrangement of functional groups to permit the mode of action, However, this leaves the paradox of how to describe both scaffold similarity and dissimilarity simultaneously.

In this paper, the current statuses of scaffolds and scaffold hopping are reviewed based on published examples of scaffold hopping from the literature. An investigation of the degree to which it is possible to formulate a more rigorous definition of scaffolds and hopping in the context of molecular topologies is considered. These techniques are adapted from chemoinformatics to be applied in the design of new medicinal compounds.},

@article{Momparler:2003aa,
	Abstract = {Aberrant DNA methylation of the promoter region is a key mechanism for inactivation of genes that suppress tumorigenesis. Genes that are involved in every step of tumor formation can be silenced by this mechanism. Inhibitors of DNA methylation, such as 5-azadeoxycytidine (5AZA), can reverse this epigenetic event suggesting a potential use in cancer therapy. The structure of chromatin can also play an important role with respect to the regulation of gene expression. Chromatin containing hypoacetylated lysines in histones has a compact structure that is repressive for transcription. Inhibitors of histone deacetylase (HDAC) can convert chromatin to an open structure and activate certain genes that inhibit tumor growth. These HDAC inhibitors also have potential in cancer therapy. A 'cross-talk' between DNA methylation and histone deacetylation can occur and work in concert to silence gene expression. The molecular mechanism involves the attachment of a methylated CpG binding protein (MBP) to the methylated promoters and its recruitment of HDAC to form a complex that suppresses transcription. These two epigenetic modi. cations represent an interesting target for therapeutic intervention using 5AZA and HDAC inhibitors. These agents in combination have been shown to produce a synergistic reactivation of tumor suppressor genes and an enhanced antineoplastic effect against tumor cells, and should be investigated as a novel form of epigenetic therapy for cancer.},

	Abstract = {The following is a position paper challenging the paradigm that 'carcinogen = mutagen', and that the current rodent bioassay to predict risks to human cancers is relevant and useful. Specifically, we review current observations concerning carcinogenesis that might lead to another approach for assessing the identification of human carcinogenic hazards and the risk assessment that chemicals might pose. We give a brief review of the multistage and multimechanism process of cancer in a tissue that involves not only genotoxic but also epigenetic events, and the importance of stem and progenitor cells in the development of cancer. We focus on the often ignored 'epigenetic' effects of carcinogens and the role of cell communication systems in epigenetically altering gene expression that leads to an imbalance of cell proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis in a tissue that can contribute to the cancer process. To draw attention to the fact that the current paradigm and policy to test toxic chemicals is often misleading and incorrect, we discuss how oxidative stress, in spite of the DNA damaging data, most probably contributes to cancer at the epigenetic level. Additionally, we briefly review how this mutagenic concept has greatly diverted attention away from doing research on the lower molecular weight, non-genotoxic, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), and how these low molecular weight PAHs are etiologically more relevant to the disease potential of environmental mixtures such as cigarette smoke.},

@article{Ghoshal:1999aa,
	Abstract = {Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are known carcinogens, but most research on their toxicity in the development of human-risk assessment models has focused on genotoxicity. Many nongenotoxic PAHs, however, have been shown to be epigenetically toxic by disrupting gap junctional intercellular communication (GJIC), an effect which has been affiliated with tumor promotion. We therefore used GJIC as an epigenetic biomarker to assess the toxic effect of a nonaqueous phase liquid (NAPL) mixture of PAHs commonly found in coal tar and creosote products. The NAPL mixture consisted of toluene,naphthalene, 1-methylnaphthalene, 2-ethylnaphthalene, acenaphthene, fluorene, phenanthrene, fluoranthene, and pyrene. This mixture reversibly inhibited GJIC at a maximal and noncytotoxic dose of 60 mu M. Inhibition occurred within 5 min, indicating a post-translational modification of gap junction proteins. Biodegradation of globules of this mixture suspended in mineral media by a microorganism isolated from creosote-contaminated soils resulted in the removal of all but three heavy PAHs: acenaphthene, pyrene, and fluoranthene. a reconstituted mixture of these three compounds showed results on GJIC activity identical to the original mixture relative to dose-, rate-, and time-responses, indicating that the toxicity of the PAHs was additive. The results suggest that bioremediation techniques that leave residual components of such NAPL mixtures in contaminated media can quantitatively but not qualitatively reduce their epigenetic toxic risk. Nonetheless, such bioresistant residuals may be environmentally less mobile than the biodegraded components of the precursor NAPLs.},

@article{Horvath:2008aa,
	Abstract = {The merging of network theory and microarray data analysis techniques has spawned a new field: gene coexpression network analysis. While network methods are increasingly used in biology, the network vocabulary of computational biologists tends to be far more limited than that of, say, social network theorists. Here we review and propose several potentially useful network concepts. We take advantage of the relationship between network theory and the field of microarray data analysis to clarify the meaning of and the relationship among network concepts in gene coexpression networks. Network theory offers a wealth of intuitive concepts for describing the pairwise relationships among genes, which are depicted in cluster trees and heat maps. Conversely, microarray data analysis techniques (singular value decomposition, tests of differential expression) can also be used to address difficult problems in network theory. We describe conditions when a close relationship exists between network analysis and microarray data analysis techniques, and provide a rough dictionary for translating between the two fields. Using the angular interpretation of correlations, we provide a geometric interpretation of network theoretic concepts and derive unexpected relationships among them. We use the singular value decomposition of module expression data to characterize approximately factorizable gene coexpression networks, i.e., adjacency matrices that factor into node specific contributions. High and low level views of coexpression networks allow us to study the relationships among modules and among module genes, respectively. We characterize coexpression networks where hub genes are significant with respect to a microarray sample trait and show that the network concept of intramodular connectivity can be interpreted as a fuzzy measure of module membership. We illustrate our results using human, mouse, and yeast microarray gene expression data. The unification of coexpression network methods with traditional data mining methods can inform the application and development of systems biologic methods.},

	Abstract = {It has been a long-standing goal in systems biology to find relations between the topological properties and functional features of protein networks. However, most of the focus in network studies has been on highly connected proteins (``hubs''). As a complementary notion, it is possible to define bottlenecks as proteins with a high betweenness centrality (i.e., network nodes that have many ``shortest paths''going through them, analogous to major bridges and tunnels on a highway map). Bottlenecks are, in fact, key connector proteins with surprising functional and dynamic properties. In particular, they are more likely to be essential proteins. In fact, in regulatory and other directed networks, betweenness (i.e., ``bottleneck-ness'') is a much more significant indicator of essentiality than degree (i.e., ``hub-ness''). Furthermore, bottlenecks correspond to the dynamic components of the interaction network---they are significantly less well coexpressed with their neighbors than nonbottlenecks, implying that expression dynamics is wired into the network topology.},

	Abstract = {Abstract: The estimation of the accuracy of predictions is a critical problem in QSAR modeling. The distance to model can be defined as a metric that defines the similarity between the training set molecules and the test set compound for the given property in the context of a specific model. It could be expressed in many different ways, e.g., using Tanimoto coefficient, leverage, correlation in space of models, etc. In this paper we have used mixtures of Gaussian distributions as well as statistical tests to evaluate six types of distances to models with respect to their ability to discriminate compounds with small and large prediction errors. The analysis was performed for twelve QSAR models of aqueous toxicity against T. pyriformis obtained with different machine-learning methods and various types of descriptors. The distances to model based on standard deviation of predicted toxicity calculated from the ensemble of models afforded the best results. This distance also successfully discriminated molecules with low and large prediction errors for a mechanism-based model developed using log P and the Maximum Acceptor Superdelocalizability descriptors. Thus, the distance to model metric could also be used to augment mechanistic QSAR models by estimating their prediction errors. Moreover, the accuracy of prediction is mainly determined by the training set data distribution in the chemistry and activity spaces but not by QSAR approaches used to develop the models. We have shown that incorrect validation of a model may result in the wrong estimation of its performance and suggested how this problem could be circumvented. The toxicity of 3182 and 48774 molecules from the EPA High Production Volume (HPV) Challenge Program and EINECS (European chemical Substances Information System), respectively, was predicted, and the accuracy of prediction was estimated. The developed models are available online at http://www.qspr.org site.},

	Abstract = {Atomistic simulations of protein folding have the potential to be a great complement to experimental studies, but have been severely limited by the time scales accessible with current computer hardware and algorithms. By employing a worldwide distributed computing network of tens of thousands of PCs and algorithms designed to efficiently utilize this new many-processor, highly heterogeneous, loosely coupled distributed computing paradigm, we have been able to simulate hundreds of microseconds of atomistic molecular dynamics. This has allowed us to directly simulate the folding mechanism and to accurately predict the folding rate of several fast-folding proteins and polymers, including a nonbiological helix, polypeptide alpha-helices, a beta-hairpin, and a three-helix bundle protein from the villin headpiece. Our results demonstrate that one can reach the time scales needed to simulate fast folding using distributed computing, and that potential sets used to describe interatomic interactions are sufficiently accurate to reach the folded state with experimentally validated rates, at least for small proteins.

	Abstract = {The continuous increasing of computing power in biological research places a threshold to the single host use and suggests an approach based on distributed computing. An emerging solution is grid technology, which allows organization to make better use of existing computing resources by providing them with a single, transparent, aggregated source of computing power. Equally, bioinformatics analysis often involves many web services, allowing shared access to information and helping the biologist to design, describe, record complex experiments. A new generation of grid infrastructure. where web services are building blocks, allow managent of a web services workflow.

The application porting over the grid and its extension as a web service over local and wide area networks is fully outlined. A description of the procedures developed for this experiment is given in full detail and the applicability of the methodology to similar codes in this scientific area is assessed. The new developed, grid-aware, application has been tested by performing a comprehensive set of benchmarks including quantum mechanical calculations on the water molecule. The obtained results of the benchmarks are reported and a full comparison with respect to the parallel execution of the same tests using the standard code is discussed in detail.},

@article{Casher:2006aa,
	Abstract = {Abstract: SemanticEye, an ontology with associated tools, improves the classification and open accessibility of chemical information in electronic publishing. In a manner analogous to digital music management, RDF metadata encoded as Adobe XMP can be extracted from a variety of document formats, such as PDF, and managed in an RDF repository called Sesame. Users upload electronic documents containing XMP to a central server by "dropping" them into WebDAV folders. The documents can then be navigated in a Web browser via their metadata, and multiple documents containing identical metadata can then be aggregated. SemanticEye does not actually store any documents. By including unique identifiers within the XMP, such as the DOI, associated documents can be retrieved from the Web with the help of resolving agents. The power of this metadata driven approach is illustrated by including, within the XMP, InChI identifiers for molecular structures and finding relationships between articles based on their InChIs. SemanticEye will become increasingly more comprehensive as usage becomes more widespread. Furthermore, following the Semantic Web architecture enables the reuse of open software tools, provides a "semantically intuitive" alternative to search engines, and fosters a greater sense of trust in Web-based scientific information.},

	Abstract = {Abstract: With the expansion of the Internet and World Wide Web (or the Web), research environments have changed dramatically. As a result, the need to be able to efficiently and securely access information and resources from remote computer systems is becoming even more critical. This paper describes the development of an extendable integrated Web-accessible simulation environment for computational science and engineering called Computational Science and Engineering Online (CSE-Online; http://cse-online.net). CSE-Online is based on a unique client-server software architecture that can distribute the workload between the client and server computers in such a way as to minimize the communication between the client and server, thus making the environment less-sensitive to network instability. Furthermore, the new software architecture allows the user to access data and resources on one or more remote servers as well as on the computing grid while having the full capability of the Web-services collaborative environment. It can be accessed anytime and anywhere from a Web browser connected to the network by either a wired or wireless connection. It has different modes of operations to support different working environments and styles. CSE-Online is evolving into middleware that can provide a framework for accessing and managing remote data and resources including the computing grid for any domain, not necessarily just within computational science and engineering. †},

	Abstract = {Background: Grid computing has great potential to become a standard cyberinfrastructure for life sciences which often require high-performance computing and large data handling which exceeds the computing capacity of a single institution.

Results: This survey reviews the latest grid technologies from the viewpoints of computing grid, data grid and knowledge grid. Computing grid technologies have been matured enough to solve high-throughput real-world life scientific problems. Data grid technologies are strong candidates for realizing "resourceome" for bioinformatics. Knowledge grids should be designed not only from sharing explicit knowledge on computers but also from community formulation for sharing tacit knowledge among a community.

Conclusion: Extending the concept of grid from computing grid to knowledge grid, it is possible to make use of a grid as not only sharable computing resources, but also as time and place in which people work together, create knowledge, and share knowledge and experiences in a community.},

	Abstract = {An application of e-science methodology and grid networking technology is presented that opens up new possibilities to enhance the operation of large high-throughput service-crystallography facilities, exemplified by the UK National Crystallography Service (NCS). A seamless distributed computing approach is used to provide remote secure visualization, monitoring and interaction with the laboratory and the diffraction experiment, supervision and input to the data workup and analysis processes, and to enable dissemination and further use of the resulting structural data. The architecture of the system is based on web and grid services ( in particular the use of Globus, v1.1.4), which provide a secure environment for two-way information flow and communication between the service users and operators. This capability will enhance operations of instrument and software automation by providing more efficient use of the resources, increasing the throughput of samples and enabling interactions with distributed chemistry information databases, computational services and networks. The viability of these interactions is assessed and directions for future crystallography services suggested. The setup would be equally applicable to protein or powder crystallography services.},

This paper outlines the two strands of this service, which (a) enable a user to contribute in the conduction of an experiment and (b) provide an effective route for the archival and dissemination of the arising results. Access to use the NCS facilities and expertise and a mechanism to submit samples is granted through a secure Grid infrastructure, which seamlessly provides instantaneous feedback and the ability to remotely monitor and guide diffraction experiments and stage the diffraction data to a securely accessible location. Publication of all the data and results generated during the course of the experiment, from processed data to analyzed structures, is then enabled by means of an open access data repository. The repository publishes its content through established digital libraries' protocols, which enable harvester and aggregator services to make the data searchable and accessible.},

	Abstract = {Abstract: W3C standardized Web Services are becoming an increasingly popular middleware technology used to facilitate the open exchange of chemical data. While several projects in existence use Web Services to wrap existing commercial and open-source tools that mine chemical structure data, no Web Service infrastructure has yet been developed to compute thermochemical properties of substances. This work presents an infrastructure of Web Services for thermochemical data retrieval. Several examples are presented to demonstrate how our Web Services can be called from Java, through JavaScript using an AJAX methodology, and within commonly used commercial applications such as Microsoft Excel and MATLAB for use in computational work. We illustrate how a JANAF table, widely used by chemists and engineers, can be quickly reproduced through our Web Service infrastructure.},

	Abstract = {Abstract: This paper describes the AnnoCryst system-a tool that was designed to enable authenticated collaborators to share online discussions about 3D crystallographic structures through the asynchronous attachment, storage, and retrieval of annotations. Annotations are personal comments, interpretations, questions, assessments, or references that can be attached to files, data, digital objects, or Web pages. The AnnoCryst system enables annotations to be attached to 3D crystallographic models retrieved from either private local repositories (e.g., Fedora) or public online databases (e.g., Protein Data Bank or Inorganic Crystal Structure Database) via a Web browser. The system uses the Jmol plugin for viewing and manipulating the 3D crystal structures but extends Jmol by providing an additional interface through which annotations can be created, attached, stored, searched, browsed, and retrieved. The annotations are stored on a standardized Web annotation server (Annotea), which has been extended to support 3D macromolecular structures. Finally, the system is embedded within a security framework that is capable of authenticating users and restricting access only to trusted colleagues.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND:Aptamers are nucleic acids selected for their ability to bind to molecules of interest and may provide the basis for a whole new class of medicines. If the aptamer is simply a dsDNA molecule with a ssDNA overhang (a "sticky" end) then the segment of ssDNA that complements that overhang provides a known binding target with binding strength adjustable according to length of overhang.RESULTS:Two bifunctional aptamers are examined using a nanopore detector. They are chosen to provide sensitive, highly modulated, blockade signals with their captured ends, while their un-captured regions are designed to have binding moieties for complementary ssDNA targets. The bifunctional aptamers are duplex DNA on their channel-captured portion, and single-stranded DNA on their portion with binding ability. For short ssDNA, the binding is merely to the complementary strand of DNA, which is what is studied here - for 5-base and 6-base overhangs.CONCLUSION:A preliminary statistical analysis using hidden Markov models (HMMs) indicates a clear change in the blockade pattern upon binding by the single captured aptamer. This is also consistent with the hypothesis that significant conformational changes occur during the annealing binding event. In further work the objective is to simply extend this ssDNA portion to be a well-studied ~80 base ssDNA aptamer, joined to the same bifunctional aptamer molecular platform.},

	Abstract = {Abstract~~The use of inaccurate scoring functions in docking algorithms may result in the selection of compounds with high predicted binding affinity that nevertheless are known experimentally not to bind to the target receptor. Such falsely predicted binders have been termed `binding decoys'. We posed a question as to whether true binders and decoys could be distinguished based only on their structural chemical descriptors using approaches commonly used in ligand based drug design. We have applied the k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN) classification QSAR approach to a dataset of compounds characterized as binders or binding decoys of AmpC beta-lactamase. Models were subjected to rigorous internal and external validation as part of our standard workflow and a special QSAR modeling scheme was employed that took into account the imbalanced ratio of inhibitors to non-binders (1:4) in this dataset. 342 predictive models were obtained with correct classification rate (CCR) for both training and test sets as high as 0.90 or higher. The prediction accuracy was as high as 100% (CCR&nbsp;=&nbsp;1.00) for the external validation set composed of 10 compounds (5 true binders and 5 decoys) selected randomly from the original dataset. For an additional external set of 50 known non-binders, we have achieved the CCR of 0.87 using very conservative model applicability domain threshold. The validated binary kNN QSAR models were further employed for mining the NCGC AmpC screening dataset (69653 compounds). The consensus prediction of 64 compounds identified as screening hits in the AmpC PubChem assay disagreed with their annotation in PubChem but was in agreement with the results of secondary assays. At the same time, 15 compounds were identified as potential binders contrary to their annotation in PubChem. Five of them were tested experimentally and showed inhibitory activities in millimolar range with the highest binding constant Ki of 135&nbsp;μM. Our studies suggest that validated QSAR models could complement structure based docking and scoring approaches in identifying promising hits by virtual screening of molecular libraries. },

	Abstract = {Workflow technology is being increasingly applied in discovery information to organize and analyze data. SciTegic's Pipeline Pilot is a chemically intelligent implementation of a workflow technology known as data pipelining. It allows scientists to construct and execute workflows using components that encapsulate many cheminformatics based algorithms. In this paper we review SciTegic's methodology for molecular fingerprints, molecular similarity, molecular clustering, maximal common subgraph search and Bayesian learning. Case studies are described showing the application of these methods to the analysis of discovery data such as chemical series and high throughput screening results. The paper demonstrates that the methods are well suited to a wide variety of tasks such as building and applying predictive models of screening data, identifying molecules for lead optimization and the organization of molecules into families with structural commonality.},

	Abstract = {For a number of years MDL products have exposed both 166 bit and 960 bit keysets based on 2D descriptors. These keysets were originally constructed and optimized for substructure searching. We report on improvements in the performance of MDL keysets which are reoptimized for use in molecular similarity. Classification performance for a test data set of 957 compounds was increased from 0.65 for the 166 bit keyset and 0.67 for the 960 bit keyset to 0.71 for a surprisal S/N pruned keyset containing 208 bits and 0.71 for a genetic algorithm optimized keyset containing 548 bits. We present an overview of the underlying technology supporting the definition of descriptors and the encoding of these descriptors into keysets. This technology allows definition of descriptors as combinations of atom properties, bond properties, and atomic neighborhoods at various topological separations as well as supporting a number of custom descriptors. These descriptors can then be used to set one or more bits in a keyset. We constructed various keysets and optimized their performance in clustering bioactive substances. Performance was measured using methodology developed by Briem and Lessel. "Directed pruning" was carried out by eliminating bits from the keysets on the basis of random selection, values of the surprisal of the bit, or values of the surprisal S/N ratio of the bit. The random pruning experiment highlighted the insensitivity of keyset performance for keyset lengths of more than 1000 bits. Contrary to initial expectations, pruning on the basis of the surprisal values of the various bits resulted in keysets which underperformed those resulting from random pruning. In contrast, pruning on the basis of the surprisal SIN ratio was found to yield keysets which performed better than those resulting from random pruning. We also explored the use of genetic algorithms in the selection of optimal keysets. Once more the performance was only a weak function of keyset size, and the optimizations failed to identify a single globally optimal keyset. Instead multiple, equally optimal keysets could be produced which had relatively low overlap of the descriptors they encoded.},

	Abstract = {QSPR studies, using scores of SciTegic's extended connectivity fingerprint as raw descriptors, were extended to the prediction of melting points and aqueous solubility of organic compounds. Robust partial least-squares models were developed that perform as well as the best published QSPR models for structurally diverse organic compounds. Satisfactory performance of the QSPR models indicates that the scores of extended connectivity fingerprint are high performance molecular descriptors for QSAR/QSPR studies. Performance of the fingerprint-based descriptors is further validated by the satisfactory prediction of aqueous solubility of nearly 1300 organic compounds (squared correlation coefficient of 0.83 and RMSE of 0.85 log unit) with Yalkowsky's general solubility equation using both calculated melting points and calculated octanol-water partition coefficients. It demonstrates for the first time that it is feasible to predict aqueous solubility of structurally diverse organic compounds with the general solubility equation using both the calculated melting points and the partition coefficients.},

	Abstract = {Alzheimer's disease (AD) has been treated with acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitors such as donepezil. However, the clinical usefulness of AChE inhibitors is limited mainly due to their adverse peripheral effects. Depression seen in AD patients has been treated with serotonin transporter (SERT) inhibitors. We considered that combining SERT and AChE inhibition could improve the clinical usefulness of AChE inhibitors. In a previous paper, we found a potential dual inhibitor, 1, of AChE (IC50 = 101 nM) and SERT (IC50 = 42 nM), but its AChE inhibition activity was less than donepezil (IC50 = 10 nM). Here, we report the conformationally restricted (R)-18a considerably enhanced inhibitory activity against AChE (IC50 14 nM) and SERT (IC50 = 6 nM). (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

@article{Bender:2004aa,
	Abstract = {Abstract: A molecular similarity searching technique based on atom environments, information-gain-based feature selection, and the naive Bayesian classifier has been applied to a series of diverse datasets and its performance compared to those of alternative searching methods. Atom environments are count vectors of heavy atoms present at a topological distance from each heavy atom of a molecular structure. In this application, using a recently published dataset of more than 100000 molecules from the MDL Drug Data Report database, the atom environment approach appears to outperform fusion of ranking scores as well as binary kernel discrimination, which are both used in combination with Unity fingerprints. Overall retrieval rates among the top 5% of the sorted library are nearly 10% better (more than 14% better in relative numbers) than those of the second best method, Unity fingerprints and binary kernel discrimination. In 10 out of 11 sets of active compounds the combination of atom environments and the naive Bayesian classifier appears to be the superior method, while in the remaining dataset, data fusion and binary kernel discrimination in combination with Unity fingerprints is the method of choice. Binary kernel discrimination in combination with Unity fingerprints generally comes second in performance overall. The difference in performance can largely be attributed to the different molecular descriptors used. Atom environments outperform Unity fingerprints by a large margin if the combination of these descriptors with the Tanimoto coefficient is compared. The naive Bayesian classifier in combination with information-gain-based feature selection and selection of a sensible number of features performs about as well as binary kernel discrimination in experiments where these classification methods are compared. When used on a monoaminooxidase dataset, atom environments and the naive Bayesian classifier perform as well as binary kernel discrimination in the case of a 50/50 split of training and test compounds. In the case of sparse training data, binary kernel discrimination is found to be superior on this particular dataset. On a third dataset, the atom environment descriptor shows higher retrieval rates than other 2D fingerprints tested here when used in combination with the Tanimoto similarity coefficient. Feature selection is shown to be a crucial step in determining the performance of the algorithm. The representation of molecules by atom environments is found to be more effective than Unity fingerprints for the type of biological receptor similarity calculations examined here. Combining information prior to scoring and including information about inactive compounds, as in the Bayesian classifier and binary kernel discrimination, is found to be superior to posterior data fusion (in the datasets tested here).},

The computational biology community has made strides in characterizing human disease and implementing algorithms that will be used in translational medicine. Despite this progress, most of the identified biomarkers and proposed methodologies have still not achieved the sensitivity and specificity to be effectively used, for example, in population screening against various diseases. Here we review the current progress in computational methodology developed to exploit major high-throughput experimental platforms towards improved understanding of disease, and argue that an integrated model for biomarker discovery, predictive medicine and treatment is likely to be data-driven and personalized. In such an approach, major data collection is yet to be done and comprehensive computational models are yet to be developed.},

	Abstract = {One of the most important tasks of modern bioinformatics is the development of computational tools that can be used to understand and treat human disease. To date, a variety of methods have been explored and algorithms for candidate gene prioritization are gaining in their usefulness. Here, we propose an algorithm for detecting gene-disease associations based on the human protein-protein interaction network, known gene-disease associations, protein sequence, and protein functional information at the molecular level. Our method, PhenoPred, is supervised: first, we mapped each gene/protein onto the spaces of disease and functional terms based on distance to all annotated proteins in the protein interaction network. We also encoded sequence, function, physicochemical, and predicted structural properties, such as secondary structure and flexibility. We then trained support vector machines to detect gene-disease associations for a number of terms in Disease Ontology and provided evidence that, despite the noise/incompleteness of experimental data and unfinished ontology of diseases, identification of candidate genes can be successful even when a large number of candidate disease terms are predicted on simultaneously.

@article{Dixon:2001aa,
	Abstract = {Abstract: Drug discovery research is increasingly dedicated to biological screening on a massive scale, which seems to imply a basic rejection of many computer-assisted techniques originally designed to add rationality to the early stages of discovery. While ever-faster and more clever 3D methodologies continue to be developed and rejected as alternatives to indiscriminant screening, simpler tools based on 2D structure have carved a stable niche in the high-throughput paradigm of drug discovery. Their staying power is due in no small part to simplicity, ease of use, and demonstrated ability to explain structure-activity data. This observation led us to wonder whether an even simpler view of structure might offer an advantage over existing 2D and 3D methods. Accordingly, we introduce 1D representations of chemical structure, which are generated by collapsing a 3D molecular model or a 2D chemical graph onto a single coordinate of atomic positions. Atoms along this coordinate are differentiated according to elemental type, hybridization, and connectivity. By aligning 1D representations to match up identical atom types, a measure of overall structural similarity is afforded. In extensive structure-activity validation tests, 1D similarities consistently outperform both Daylight 2D fingerprints and Cerius2 pharmacophore fingerprints, suggesting that this new, simple means of representing and comparing structures may offer a significant advantage over existing tried-and-true methods.},

	Abstract = {Abstract: Structure-based virtual screening is a promising tool to identify putative targets for a specific ligand. Instead of docking multiple ligands into a single protein cavity, a single ligand is docked in a collection of binding sites. In inverse screening, hits are in fact targets which have been prioritized within the pool of best ranked proteins. The target rate depends on specificity and promiscuity in proteinligand interactions and, to a considerable extent, on the effectiveness of the scoring function, which still is the Achilles heel of molecular docking. In the present retrospective study, virtual screening of the sc-PDB target library by GOLD docking was carried out for four compounds (biotin, 4-hydroxy-tamoxifen, 6-hydroxy-1,6-dihydropurine ribonucleoside, and methotrexate) of known sc-PDB targets and, several ranking protocols based on GOLD fitness score and topological molecular interaction fingerprint (IFP) comparison were evaluated. For the four investigated ligands, the fusion of GOLD fitness and two IFP scores allowed the recovery of most targets, including the rare proteins which are not readily suitable for statistical analysis, while significantly filtering out most false positive entries. The current survey suggests that selecting a small number of targets (<20) for experimental evaluation is achievable with a pure structure-based approach.},

	Abstract = {Abstract: The sc-PDB is a collection of 6 415 three-dimensional structures of binding sites found in the Protein Data Bank (PDB). Binding sites were extracted from all high-resolution crystal structures in which a complex between a protein cavity and a small-molecular-weight ligand could be identified. Importantly, ligands are considered from a pharmacological and not a structural point of view. Therefore, solvents, detergents, and most metal ions are not stored in the sc-PDB. Ligands are classified into four main categories: nucleotides (< 4-mer), peptides (< 9-mer), cofactors, and organic compounds. The corresponding binding site is formed by all protein residues (including amino acids, cofactors, and important metal ions) with at least one atom within 6.5 ≈ of any ligand atom. The database was carefully annotated by browsing several protein databases (PDB, UniProt, and GO) and storing, for every sc-PDB entry, the following features: protein name, function, source, domain and mutations, ligand name, and structure. The repository of ligands has also been archived by diversity analysis of molecular scaffolds, and several chemoinformatics descriptors were computed to better understand the chemical space covered by stored ligands. The sc-PDB may be used for several purposes: (i) screening a collection of binding sites for predicting the most likely target(s) of any ligand, (ii) analyzing the molecular similarity between different cavities, and (iii) deriving rules that describe the relationship between ligand pharmacophoric points and active-site properties. The database is periodically updated and accessible on the web at http://bioinfo-pharma.u-strasbg.fr/scPDB/.},

	Abstract = {Abstract: A kinetic, reactivity-binding model has been proposed to predict the regioselectivity of substrates meditated by the CYP1A2 enzyme, which is responsible for the metabolism of planar-conjugated compounds such as caffeine. This model consists of a docking simulation for binding energy and a semiempirical molecular orbital calculation for activation energy. Possible binding modes of CYP1A2 substrates were first examined using automated docking based on the crystal structure of CYP1A2, and binding energy was calculated. Then, activation energies for CYP1A2-mediated metabolism reactions were calculated using the semiempirical molecular orbital calculation, AM1. Finally, the metabolic probability obtained from two energy terms, binding and activation energies, was used for predicting the most probable metabolic site. This model predicted 8 out of 12 substrates accurately as the primary preferred site among all possible metabolic sites, and the other four substrates were predicted into the secondary preferred site. This method can be applied for qualitative prediction of drug metabolism mediated by CYP1A2 and other CYP450 family enzymes, helping to develop drugs efficiently.},

@article{Domingos:1997aa,
	Abstract = {The simple Bayesian classifier is known to be optimal when attributes are independent given the class, but the question of whether other sufficient conditions for its optimality exist has so far not been explored. Empirical results showing that it performs surprisingly well in many domains containing clear attribute dependences suggest that the answer to this question may be positive. This article shows that, although the Bayesian classifier's probability estimates are only optimal under quadratic loss if the independence assumption holds, the classifier itself can be optimal under zero-one loss (misclassification rate) even when this assumption is violated by a wide margin. The region of quadratic-loss optimality of the Bayesian classifier is in fact a second-order infinitesimal fraction of the region of zero-one optimality. This implies that the Bayesian classifier has a much greater range of applicability than previously thought. For example, in this article it is shown to be optimal for learning conjunctions and disjunctions, even though they violate the independence assumption. Further, studies in artificial domains show that it will often outperform more powerful classifiers for common training set sizes and numbers of attributes, even if its bias is a priori much less appropriate to the domain. This article's results also imply that detecting attribute dependence is not necessarily the best way to extend the Bayesian classifier, and this is also verified empirically.},

	Abstract = {A dataset is imbalanced if the classification categories are not approximately equally represented. Recent years brought increased interest in applying machine learning techniques to difficult ``real-world'' problems, many of which are characterized by imbalanced data. Additionally the distribution of the testing data may differ from that of the training data, and the true misclassification costs may be unknown at learning time. Predictive accuracy, a popular choice for evaluating performance of a classifier, might not be appropriate when the data is imbalanced and/or the costs of different errors vary markedly. In this Chapter, we discuss some of the sampling techniques used for balancing the datasets, and the performance measures more appropriate for mining imbalanced datasets.},

	Abstract = {Motivation: Gene expression microarray experiments can generate data sets with multiple missing expression values. Unfortunately, many algorithms for gene expression analysis require a complete matrix of gene array values as input. For example, methods such as hierarchical clustering and K-means clustering are not robust to missing data, and may lose effectiveness even with a few missing values. Methods for imputing missing data are needed, therefore, to minimize the effect of incomplete data sets on analyses, and to increase the range of data sets to which these algorithms can be applied. In this report, we investigate automated methods for estimating missing data.

Results: We present a comparative study of several methods for the estimation of missing values in gene microarray data. We implemented and evaluated three methods: a Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) based method (SVDimpute), weighted K-nearest neighbors (KNNimpute), and row average. We evaluated the methods using a variety of parameter settings and over different real data sets, and assessed the robustness of the imputation methods to the amount of missing data over the range of 1-20\% missing values. We show that KNNimpute appears to provide a more robust and sensitive method for missing value estimation than SVDimpute, and both SVDimpute and KNNimpute surpass the commonly used row average method las well as filling missing values with zeros). We report results of the comparative experiments and provide recommendations and tools for accurate estimation of missing microarray data under a variety of conditions.},

	Abstract = {This article introduces yaImpute, an R package for nearest neighbor search and imputation. Although nearest neighbor imputation is used in a host of disciplines, the methods implemented in the yaImpute package are tailored to imputation-based forest attribute estimation and mapping. The impetus to writing the yaImpute is a growing interest in nearest neighbor imputation methods for spatially explicit forest inventory, and a need within this research community for software that facilitates comparison among different nearest neighbor search algorithms and subsequent imputation techniques. yaImpute provides directives for defining the search space, subsequent distance calculation, and imputation rules for a given number of nearest neighbors. Further, the package offers a suite of diagnostics for comparison among results generated from different imputation analyses and a set of functions for mapping imputation results.},

	Abstract = {Motivation: In microarray experiments, missing entries arise from blemishes on the chips. In large-scale studies, virtually every chip contains some missing entries and more than 90\% of the genes are affected. Many analysis methods require a full set of data. Either those genes with missing entries are excluded, or the missing entries are filled with estimates prior to the analyses. This study compares methods of missing value estimation.

Results: Two evaluation metrics of imputation accuracy are employed. First, the root mean squared error measures the difference between the true values and the imputed values. Second, the number of mis-clustered genes measures the difference between clustering with true values and that with imputed values; it examines the bias introduced by imputation to clustering. The Gaussian mixture clustering with model averaging imputation is superior to all other imputation methods, according to both evaluation metrics, on both time-series (correlated) and non-time series (uncorrelated) data sets.},

	Abstract = {Gene expression microarray experiments generate data sets with multiple missing expression values. In some cases, analysis of gene expression requires a complete matrix as input. Either genes with missing values can be removed, or the missing values can be replaced using prediction. We propose six imputation methods. A comparative study of the methods was performed on data from mice and data from the bacterium Enterococcus faecalis, and a linear mixed model was used to test for differences between the methods. The study showed that different methods' capability to predict is dependent on the data, hence the ideal choice of method and number of components are different for each data set. For data with correlation structure methods based on K-nearest neighbours seemed to be best, while for data without correlation structure using the average of the gene was to be preferred.},

	Abstract = {Motivation: Gene expression microarray experiments produce datasets with frequent missing expression values. Accurate estimation of missing values is an important prerequisite for efficient data analysis as many statistical and machine learning techniques either require a complete dataset or their results are significantly dependent on the quality of such estimates. A limitation of the existing estimation methods for microarray data is that they use no external information but the estimation is based solely on the expression data. We hypothesized that utilizing a priori information on functional similarities available from public databases facilitates the missing value estimation.

Results: We investigated whether semantic similarity originating from gene ontology (GO) annotations could improve the selection of relevant genes for missing value estimation. The relative contribution of each information source was automatically estimated from the data using an adaptive weight selection procedure. Our experimental results in yeast cDNA microarray datasets indicated that by considering GO information in the k-nearest neighbor algorithm we can enhance its performance considerably, especially when the number of experimental conditions is small and the percentage of missing values is high. The increase of performance was less evident with a more sophisticated estimation method. We conclude that even a small proportion of annotated genes can provide improvements in data quality significant for the eventual interpretation of the microarray experiments.

	Abstract = {For large-scale genotyping studies, it is common for most subjects to have some missing genetic markers, even if the missing rate per marker is low. This compromises association analyses, with varying numbers of subjects contributing to analyses when performing single-marker or multi-marker analyses. In this paper, we consider eight methods to infer missing genotypes, including two haplotype reconstruction methods (local expectation maximization-EM, and fastPHASE), two k-nearest neighbor methods (original k-nearest neighbor, KNN, and a weighted k-nearest neighbor, wtKNN), three linear regression methods (backward variable selection, LM.back, least angle regression, LM.lars, and singular value decomposition, LM.svd), and a regression tree, Rtree. We evaluate the accuracy of them using single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data from the HapMap project, under a variety of conditions and parameters. We find that fastPHASE has the lowest error rates across different analysis panels and marker densities. LM.lars gives slightly less accurate estimate of missing genotypes than fastPHASE, but has better performance than the other methods.},

@article{Xiang:2008aa,
	Abstract = {Background: It is an important pre-processing step to accurately estimate missing values in microarray data, because complete datasets are required in numerous expression profile analysis in bioinformatics. Although several methods have been suggested, their performances are not satisfactory for datasets with high missing percentages.

Results: The paper explores the feasibility of doing missing value imputation with the help of gene regulatory mechanism. An imputation framework called histone acetylation information aided imputation method (HAlimpute method) is presented. It incorporates the histone acetylation information into the conventional KNN(k-nearest neighbor) and LLS(local least square) imputation algorithms for final prediction of the missing values. The experimental results indicated that the use of acetylation information can provide significant improvements in microarray imputation accuracy. The HAlimpute methods consistently improve the widely used methods such as KNN and LLS in terms of normalized root mean squared error (NRMSE). Meanwhile, the genes imputed by HAIimpute methods are more correlated with the original complete genes in terms of Pearson correlation coefficients. Furthermore, the proposed methods also outperform GOimpute, which is one of the existing related methods that use the functional similarity as the external information.

Conclusion: We demonstrated that the using of histone acetylation information could greatly improve the performance of the imputation especially at high missing percentages. This idea can be generalized to various imputation methods to facilitate the performance. Moreover, with more knowledge accumulated on gene regulatory mechanism in addition to histone acetylation, the performance of our approach can be further improved and verified.},

Different methods to handle missing values were evaluated and their influence is discussed on the selection of important proteins through multivariate techniques. The evaluated methods consisted of directly dealing with them during the multivariate analysis with the nonlinear estimation by iterative partial least squares (NIPALS) algorithm or imputing them by using either k-nearest neighbor or Bayesian principal component analysis (BPCA) before carrying out the multivariate analysis. These techniques were applied to data obtained from gels stained with classical postrunning dyes and from DIGE gels. Before applying the multivariate techniques, the normality and homoscedasticity assumptions on which parametric tests are based on were tested in order to perform a sound statistical analysis. From the three tested methods to handle missing values in our datasets, BPCA imputation of missing values showed to be the most consistent method.},

We describe the development of an empirical computational model to rank the pH-dependent aqueous solubility of drug candidates. The model consists of three core components to describe aqueous solubility. The first is a multivariate QSAR model for the prediction of the intrinsic solubility of the neutral solute. The second facet of the approach is the consideration of ionization using a predicted pKa and the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. The third aspect of the model is a novel method for assessing the effects of crystal packing on solubility through a series of short molecular dynamics simulations of an actual or hypothetical small molecule crystal structure at escalating temperatures. The model also includes a Monte Carlo error function that considers the variability of each of the underlying components of the model to estimate the 90% confidence interval of estimation. },

	Abstract = {The use of combinatorial chemistry for the generation of new lead molecules is now a well established strategy in the drug discovery process. Central to the use of combinatorial chemistry is the design and availability of high quality building blocks which are likely to afford hits from the libraries that they generate. Herein we describe "RECAP" (Retrosynthetic Combinatorial Analysis Procedure), a new computational technique designed to address this building block issue. RECAP electronically fragments molecules based on chemical knowledge. When applied to databases of biologically active molecules this allows the identification of building block fragments rich in biologically recognized elements and privileged motifs and structures. This allows the design of building blocks and the synthesis of libraries rich in biological motifs. Application of RECAP to the Derwent World Drug Index (WDI) and the molecular fragments/building blocks that this generates are discussed. We also describe a WDI fragment knowledge base which we have built which stores the drug motifs and mention its potential application in structure based drug design programs.},

@article{Lee:2008aa,
	Abstract = {Elimination of cytotoxic compounds in the early and later stages of drug discovery can help reduce the costs of research and development. Through the application of principal components analysis (PCA), we were able to data mine and prove that ~89% of the total log GI50 variance is due to the nonspecific cytotoxic nature of substances. Furthermore, PCA led to the identification of groups of structurally unrelated substances showing very specific toxicity profiles, such as a set of 45 substances toxic only to the Leukemia_SR cancer cell line. In an effort to predict nonspecific cytotoxicity on the basis of the mean log GI50, we created a decision tree using MACCS keys that can correctly classify over 83% of the substances as cytotoxic/noncytotoxic in silico, on the basis of the cutoff of mean log GI50 = −5.0. Finally, we have established a linear model using least-squares in which nine of the 59 available NCI60 cancer cell lines can be used to predict the mean log GI50. The model has R2 = 0.99 and a root-mean-square deviation between the observed and calculated mean log GI50 (RMSE) = 0.09. Our predictive models can be applied to flag generally cytotoxic molecules in virtual and real chemical libraries, thus saving time and effort.},

Use of the most accurate classification algorithms available for microarray gene expression data is a critical ingredient in order to develop the best possible molecular signatures for patient care. As suggested by a large body of literature to date, support vector machines can be considered "best of class" algorithms for classification of such data. Recent work, however, suggests that random forest classifiers may outperform support vector machines in this domain.},

	Abstract = {In this chapter we present the PK-tree which is an index structure for high dimensional point data. The proposed indexing structure can be viewed as combining aspects of the PR-quad or K-D tree but where unnecessary nodes are eliminated. The unnecessary nodes are typically the result of skew in the point distribution and we show that by eliminating these nodes the performance of the resulting index is robust to skewed data distributions. The index structure is formally defined, efficiently updateable and bounds on the number of nodes and the mean height of the tree can be proved. Bounds on the expected height of the tree can be given under certain mild constraints on the spatial distribution of points. Empirical evidence both on real data sets and generated data sets shows that the PK-tree outperforms the recently proposed spatial indexes based on the R-tree and X-tree by a wide margin. It is also significant that the relative performance advantage of the PK-tree grows with the dimensionality of the data set. },

	Abstract = {The binding of a small molecule to a protein is inherently a 3D matching problem. As crystal structures are not available for most drug targets, there is a need to be able to infer from bioassay data the key binding features of small molecules and their disposition in space, the pharmacophore. Fingerprints of 3D features and a modification of Gibbs sampling to align a set of known flexible ligands, where all compounds are active, are used to discern possible pharmacophores. A clique detection method is used to map the features back onto the binding conformations. The complete algorithm is described in detail, and it is shown that the method can find common superimposition for several test data sets. The method reproduces answers very close to the crystal structure and literature pharmacophores in the examples presented. The basic algorithm is relatively fast and can easily deal with up to 100 compounds and tens of thousands of conformations. The algorithm is also able to handle multiple binding mode problems, which means it can superimpose molecules within the same data set according to two different sets of binding features. We demonstrate the successful use of this algorithm for multiple binding modes for a set of D2 and D4 ligands.},

@article{Jones:1995aa,
	Abstract = {A genetic algorithm (GA) has been developed for the superimposition of sets of flexible molecules. Molecules are represented by a chromosome that encodes angles of rotation about flexible bonds and mappings between hydrogen-bond donor proton, acceptor lone pair and ring centre features in pairs of molecules. The molecule with the smallest number of features in the data set is used as a template, onto which the remaining molecules are fitted with the objective of maximising structural equivalences. The fitness function of the GA is a weighted combination of: (i) the number and the similarity of the features that have been overlaid in this way; (ii) the volume integral of the overlay; and (iii) the van der Waals energy of the molecular conformations defined by the torsion angles encoded in the chromosomes. The algorithm has been applied to a number of pharmacophore elucidation problems, i.e., angiotensin II receptor antagonists, Leu-enkephalin and a hybrid morphine molecule, 5-HT1D agonists, benzodiazepine receptor ligands, 5-HT3 antagonists, dopamine D-2 antagonists, dopamine reuptake blockers and FKBP12 ligands. The resulting pharmacophores are generated rapidly and are in good agreement with those derived from alternative means.},

	Abstract = {Mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation ( OXPHOS) is under the control of both mitochondrial ( mtDNA) and nuclear genomes and is central to energy homeostasis. To investigate how its function and regulation are integrated within cells, we systematically combined four cell-based assays of OXPHOS physiology with multiplexed measurements of nuclear and mtDNA gene expression across 2,490 small-molecule perturbations in cultured muscle. Mining the resulting compendium revealed, first, that protein synthesis inhibitors can decouple coordination of nuclear and mtDNA transcription; second, that a subset of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, combined with propranolol, can cause mitochondrial toxicity, yielding potential clues about the etiology of statin myopathy; and, third, that structurally diverse microtubule inhibitors stimulate OXPHOS transcription while suppressing reactive oxygen species, via a transcriptional mechanism involving PGC-1 alpha and ERR alpha, and thus may be useful in treating age-associated degenerative disorders. Our screening compendium can be used as a discovery tool both for understanding mitochondrial biology and toxicity and for identifying novel therapeutics.},

	Abstract = {Affinity purification of interacting proteins from cellular extracts is a powerful technique for identifying the cellular targets of small molecules. Affinity matrix-based small-molecule reagents are usually prepared by conjugating small molecules of interest to a solid support such as agarose.

	Abstract = {DrugBank is a richly annotated resource that combines detailed drug data with comprehensive drug target and drug action information. Since its first release in 2006, DrugBank has been widely used to facilitate in silico drug target discovery, drug design, drug docking or screening, drug metabolism prediction, drug interaction prediction and general pharmaceutical education. The latest version of DrugBank (release 2.0) has been expanded significantly over the previous release. With similar to 4900 drug entries, it now contains 60 more FDA-approved small molecule and biotech drugs including 10\% more experimental drugs. Significantly, more protein target data has also been added to the database, with the latest version of DrugBank containing three times as many non-redundant protein or drug target sequences as before (1565 versus 524). Each DrugCard entry now contains more than 100 data fields with half of the information being devoted to drug/chemical data and the other half devoted to pharmacological, pharmacogenomic and molecular biological data. A number of new data fields, including fooddrug interactions, drugdrug interactions and experimental ADME data have been added in response to numerous user requests. DrugBank has also significantly improved the power and simplicity of its structure query and text query searches. DrugBank is available at http://www.drugbank.ca.},

	Abstract = {Background: The tools that are available to draw and to manipulate the representations of metabolism are usually restricted to metabolic pathways. This limitation becomes problematic when studying processes that span several pathways. The various attempts that have been made to draw genome-scale metabolic networks are confronted with two shortcomings: 1- they do not use contextual information which leads to dense, hard to interpret drawings, 2- they impose to fit to very constrained standards, which implies, in particular, duplicating nodes making topological analysis considerably more difficult.
Results: We propose a method, called MetaViz, which enables to draw a genome-scale metabolic network and that also takes into account its structuration into pathways. This method consists in two steps: a clustering step which addresses the pathway overlapping problem and a drawing step which consists in drawing the clustered graph and each cluster.
Conclusion: The method we propose is original and addresses new drawing issues arising from the no-duplication constraint. We do not propose a single drawing but rather several alternative ways of presenting metabolism depending on the pathway on which one wishes to focus. We believe that this provides a valuable tool to explore the pathway structure of metabolism.},

	Abstract = {A network of disorders and disease genes linked by known disorder-gene associations offers a platform to explore in a single graph-theoretic framework all known phenotype and disease gene associations, indicating the common genetic origin of many diseases. Genes associated with similar disorders show both higher likelihood of physical interactions between their products and higher expression profiling similarity for their transcripts, supporting the existence of distinct disease-specific functional modules. We find that essential human genes are likely to encode hub proteins and are expressed widely in most tissues. This suggests that disease genes also would play a central role in the human interactome. In contrast, we find that the vast majority of disease genes are nonessential and show no tendency to encode hub proteins, and their expression pattern indicates that they are localized in the functional periphery of the network. A selection-based model explains the observed difference between essential and disease genes and also suggests that diseases caused by somatic mutations should not be peripheral, a prediction we confirm for cancer genes.},

	Abstract = {Motivation: With the rapid increase in the availability of biological graph datasets, there is a growing need for effective and efficient graph querying methods. Due to the noisy and incomplete characteristics of these datasets, exact graph matching methods have limited use and approximate graph matching methods are required. Unfortunately, existing graph matching methods are too restrictive as they only allow exact or near exact graph matching. This paper presents a novel approximate graph matching technique called SAGA. This technique employs a flexible model for computing graph similarity, which allows for node gaps, node mismatches and graph structural differences. SAGA employs an indexing technique that allows it to efficiently evaluate queries even against large graph datasets.
Results: SAGA has been used to query biological pathways and literature datasets, which has revealed interesting similarities between distinct pathways that cannot be found by existing methods. These matches associate seemingly unrelated biological processes, connect studies in different sub-areas of biomedical research and thus pose hypotheses for new discoveries. SAGA is also orders of magnitude faster than existing methods.},

@article{Fliri:2005aa,
	Abstract = {Establishing quantitative relationships between molecular structure and broad biological effects has been a longstanding challenge in science. Currently, no method exists for forecasting broad biological activity profiles of medicinal agents even within narrow boundaries of structurally similar molecules. Starting from the premise that biological activity results from the capacity of small organic molecules to modulate the activity of the proteome, we set out to investigate whether descriptor sets could be developed for measuring and quantifying this molecular property. Using a 1,567-compound database, we show that percent inhibition values, determined at single high drug concentration in a battery of in vitro assays representing a cross section of the proteome, provide precise molecular property descriptors that identify the structure of molecules. When broad biological activity of molecules is represented in spectra form, organic molecules can be sorted by quantifying differences between biological spectra. Unlike traditional structure--activity relationship methods, sorting of molecules by using biospectra comparisons does not require knowledge of a molecule's putative drug targets. To illustrate this finding, we selected as starting point the biological activity spectra of clotrimazole and tioconazole because their putative target, lanosterol demethylase (CYP51), was not included in the bioassay array. Spectra similarity obtained through profile similarity measurements and hierarchical clustering provided an unbiased means for establishing quantitative relationships between chemical structures and biological activity spectra. This methodology, which we have termed biological spectra analysis, provides the capability not only of sorting molecules on the basis of biospectra similarity but also of predicting simultaneous interactions of new molecules with multiple proteins.},

	Abstract = {The TOR (target of rapamycin) proteins play important roles in nutrient signaling in eukaryotic cells. Rapamycin treatment induces a state reminiscent of the nutrient starvation response, often resulting in growth inhibition. Using a chemical genetic modifier screen, we identified two classes of small molecules, small-molecule inhibitors of rapamycin (SMIRs) and small-molecule enhancers of rapamycin (SMERs), that suppress and augment, respectively, rapamycin's effect in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Probing proteome chips with biotinylated SMIRs revealed putative intracellular target proteins, including Tep1p, a homolog of the mammalian PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted on chromosome 10) tumor suppressor, and Ybr077cp (Nir1p), a protein of previously unknown function that we show to be a component of the TOR signaling network. Both SMIR target proteins are associated with PI(3,4)P-2, suggesting a mechanism of regulation of the TOR pathway involving phosphatidylinositides. Our results illustrate the combined use of chemical genetics and proteomics in biological discovery and map a path for creating Useful therapeutics for treating human diseases involving the TOR pathway, such as diabetes and cancer.},

	Abstract = {Motivation: Many bioinformatics data resources not only hold data in the form of sequences, but also as annotation. In the majority of cases, annotation is written as scientific natural language: this is suitable for humans, but not particularly useful for machine processing. Ontologies offer a mechanism by which knowledge can be represented in a form capable of such processing. In this paper we investigate the use of ontological annotation to measure the similarities in knowledge content or 'semantic similarity' between entries in a data resource. These allow a bioinformatician to perform a similarity measure over annotation in an analogous manner to those performed over sequences. A measure of semantic similarity for the knowledge component of bioinformatics resources should afford a biologist a new tool in their repetoire of analyses.
Results: We present the results from experiments that investigate the validity of using semantic similarity by comparison with sequence similarity. We show a simple extension that enables a semantic search of the knowledge held within sequence databases.},

	Abstract = {We suggest that common principles underlie both cellular signaling networks and chromatin. To exemplify similarities, we focus on signaling complexes that form at membrane receptors and on nucleosomes. Multiple signal-transducing modifications on side chain residues of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) and histone proteins are used to create docking sites that facilitate proximal relations of enzymes and their substrates. We argue that multiple histone modifications, like RTK modifications, promote switch-like behavior and ensure robustness of the signal, and we compare this interpretation with the histone code hypothesis. This view provides insight into chromatin function and epigenetic inheritance.},

	Abstract = {Networks of coupled dynamical systems have been used to model biological oscillators(1-4), Josephson junction arrays(5,6), excitable media(7), neural networks(8-10), spatial games(11), genetic control networks(12) and many other self-organizing systems. Ordinarily, the connection topology is assumed to be either completely regular or completely random. But many biological, technological and social networks lie somewhere between these two extremes. Here we explore simple models of networks that can be tuned through this middle ground: regular networks 'rewired' to introduce increasing amounts of disorder. We find that these systems can be highly clustered, like regular lattices, yet have small characteristic path lengths, like random graphs. We call them 'small-world' networks, by analogy with the small-world phenomenon(13,14) (popularly known as six degrees of separation(15)). The neural network of the worm Caenorhabditis elegans, the power grid of the western United States, and the collaboration graph of film actors are shown to be small-world networks. Models of dynamical systems with small-world coupling display enhanced signal-propagation speed, computational power, and synchronizability. In particular, infectious diseases spread more easily in small-world networks than in regular lattices.},

@article{Guha:2008ac,
	Abstract = {The goal of a quantitative structure--activity relationship (QSAR) model is to encode the relationship between molecular structure and biological activity or physical property. Based on this encoding, such models can be used for predictive purposes. Assuming the use of relevant and meaningful descriptors, and a statistically significant model, extraction of the encoded structure--activity relationships (SARs) can provide insight into what makes a molecule active or inactive. Such analyses by QSAR models are useful in a number of scenarios, such as suggesting structural modifications to enhance activity, explanation of outliers and exploratory analysis of novel SARs. In this paper we discuss the need for interpretation and an overview of the factors that affect interpretability of QSAR models. We then describe interpretation protocols for different types of models, highlighting the different types of interpretations, ranging from very broad, global, trends to very specific, case-by-case, descriptions of the SAR, using examples from the training set. Finally, we discuss a number of case studies where workers have provide some form of interpretation of a QSAR model.},

	Abstract = {The reliabilities of nine software packages commonly used in performing statistical analysis are assessed and compared. The (American) National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) data sets are used to evaluate the performance of these software packages with regard to univariate summary statistics, one-way ANOVA, linear regression, and nonlinear regression. Previous research has examined various versions of these software packages using the NIST data sets, but typically with fewer software packages than used in this study. This study provides insight into a relative comparison of a wide variety of software packages including two free statistical software packages, basic and advanced statistical software packages, and the popular Excel package. Substantive improvements from previous software reliability assessments are noted. Plots of principal components of a measure of the correct number of significant digits reveal how these packages tend to cluster for ANOVA and nonlinear regression. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

	Abstract = {A novel self-organizing algorithm for conformational sampling is introduced, in which precomputed conformations of rigid fragments are used as templates to enforce the desired geometry. Starting from completely random coordinates, the algorithm repeatedly superimposes the templates to adjust the positions of the atoms, thereby gradually refining the conformation of the molecule. Combined with pair-wise adjustments of the atoms to resolve steric clashes, conformations that satisfy all geometric constraints can be generated from this procedure. The algorithm is demonstrated to achieve good performance and promises potential applications on more challenging modeling problems. (C) 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

	Abstract = {Relationship between the topological indices and HIV-protease inhibitory activity of tetrahydropyrimidine-2-ones has been investigated. Three topological indices, Wiener's index-a distance based topological descriptor, Zagreb group parameter-an adjacency based topological descriptor and eccentric connectivity index-an adjacency-cum-distance based topological descriptor were used for the present investigations. A dataset comprising of 80 substituted tetrahydropyrimidine-2-one analogues was selected for the present studies. The values of the Wiener's index, Zagreb group parameter and eccentric connectivity index for each of the 80 compounds comprising the dataset were computed using an in-house computer program. The dataset was divided randomly into training and test sets. Resultant data was analyzed and suitable models were developed after identifying the active ranges in the training set. Subsequently, a biological activity was assigned to each of the compound involved in the test set using these models, which was then compared with the reported HIV-protease inhibitory activity. Accuracy of prediction using these models was found to vary from a minimum of similar to86\% to a maximum of similar to88\%. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

	Abstract = {This paper introduces a technique to visualise the information content of the kernel matrix and a way to interpret the ingredients of the Support Vector Regression (SVR) model. Recently, the use of Support Vector Machines (SVM) for solving classification (SVC) and regression (SVR) problems has increased substantially in the field of chemistry and chemometrics. This is mainly due to its high generalisation performance and its ability to model non-linear relationships in a unique and global manner. Modeling of non-linear relationships will be enabled by applying a kernel function. The kernel function transforms the input data, usually non-linearly related to the associated output property, into a high dimensional feature space where the non-linear relationship can be represented in a linear form. Usually, SVMs are applied as a black box technique. Hence, the model cannot be interpreted like, e.g., Partial Least Squares (PLS). For example, the PLS scores and loadings make it possible to visualise and understand the driving force behind the optimal PLS machinery.

In this study, we have investigated the possibilities to visualise and interpret the SVM model. Here, we exclusively have focused on Support Vector Regression to demonstrate these visualisation and interpretation techniques. Our observations show that we are now able to turn a SVR black box model into a transparent and interpretable regression modeling technique. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

	Abstract = {Nonlinear classifiers, e.g., support vector machines (SVMs) with radial basis function (RBF) kernels, have been used widely for automatic diagnosis of diseases because of their high accuracies. However, it is difficult to visualize the classifiers, and thus difficult to provide intuitive interpretation of results to physicians. We developed a new nonlinear kernel, the localized radial basis function (LRBF) kernel, and new visualization system visualization for risk factor analysis (VRIFA) that applies a nomogram and LRBF kernel to visualize the results of nonlinear SVMs and improve the interpretability of results while maintaining high prediction accuracy. Three representative medical datasets from the University of California, Irvine repository and Statlog dataset-breast cancer, diabetes, and heart disease datasets-were used to evaluate the system. The results showed that the classification performance of the LRBF is comparable with that of the RBF, and the LRBF is easy to visualize via a nomogram. Our study also showed that the LRBF kernel is less sensitive to noise features than the RBF kernel, whereas the LRBF kernel degrades the prediction accuracy more when important features are eliminated. We demonstrated the VRIFA system, which visualizes the results of linear and nonlinear SVMs with LRBF kernels, on the three datasets.},

In this paper we investigate the relationship between the optimal number of features and the training set size. We present a new and simple analysis of the well-studied two-Gaussian setting. We explicitly find the optimal number of features as a function of the training set size for a few special cases and show that accuracy declines dramatically by adding too many features. Then we show empirically that Support Vector Machine (SVM), that was designed to work in the presence of a large number of features produces the same qualitative result for these examples. This suggests that good feature selection is still an important component in accurate classification. },

Here we consider feature selection within a Random Forest framework. A feature selection technique is introduced that combines hypothesis testing with an approximation to the expected performance of an irrelevant feature during Random Forest construction.

It is demonstrated that the lack of implicit feature selection within Random Forest has an adverse effect on the accuracy and efficiency of the algorithm. It is also shown that irrelevant features can slow the rate of error convergence and a theoretical justification of this effect is given.},

	Abstract = {Molecular connectivity indices are identified as components of the molecular accessibility. The first- and second-order connectivity indices represent molecular accessibility areas and volumes, respectively, whereas higher order indices represent magnitudes in higher dimensional spaces. In identifying accessibility perimeters, we recognized the atom degrees as a measure of the accessibility perimeter of the corresponding atom. The Randic and connectivity indices are identified as the two components of the molecular accessibility area. The accessibility perimeter is computed here from the van der Waals and covalent radii of the atoms and the overlapping angle between the van der Waals circumferences of bonded atoms. The description of the accessibility area in terms of the first-order Randic and connectivity indices accounts for the success of these descriptors in correlating different physicochemical and biological properties because they are a measure of the extension of intermolecular interactions. A theoretical justification for the selection of the exponent in the Randic invariant is provided by the relation between the valence degree and the accessibility perimeters calculated in this work.},

	Abstract = {The predictive accuracy of the model is of the most concern for computational chemists in quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) investigations. It is hypothesized that the model based on analogical chemicals will exhibit better predictive performance than that derived from diverse compounds. This paper develops a novel scheme called "clustering first, and then modeling" to build local QSAR models for the subsets resulted from clustering of the training set according to structural similarity. For validation and prediction, the validation set and test set were first classified into the corresponding subsets just as those of the training set, and then the prediction was performed by the relevant local model for each subset. This approach was validated on two independent data sets by local modeling and prediction of the baseline toxicity for the fathead minnow. In this process, hierarchical clustering was employed for cluster analysis, k-nearest neighbor for classification, and partial least squares for the model generation. The statistical results indicated that the predictive performances of the local models based on the subsets were much superior to those of the global model based on the whole training set, which was consistent with the hypothesis. This approach proposed here is promising for extension to QSAR modeling for various physicochemical properties, biological activities, and toxicities.},

	Abstract = {There are many issues relating to the use of Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationships (QSARs) to make predictions for regulatory purposes. Among those issues, characterization of models and the development of suitable tools to determine applicability domains rank as the more important. With regard to aquatic toxicology, QSARs for acute effects (e.g., IGC(50)-1) often take the form of a hydrophobic [i.e., Logarithm of the 1-Octanol/Water Partition Coefficient (log P)]-electrophilic [e.g., Maximum Acceptor Superdelocalizability (A(max))]-dependent, regression-based model. In this study, the applicability domain of a model for the toxicity of aromatic compounds to Tetrahymena pyriformis [log (IGC50-1) =0.545(0.015) log P+ 16.2(0.62) A(max)-5.91(0.20); n = 384, r(3) (adj) = 0.859, r(3)(pred) = 0.856, s = 0.275, F= 1163, Pr > F= 0.0001] was assessed. The structural and physicochemical domains of the model were characterized using two test sets of toxicity data (one prescreened to be within the descriptor space and structural domain of the training set and the other to be outside the structural domain of the training set). For test set compounds inside the domain of the model, there was no relationship between absolute residue values for predictions and hydrophobicity; however, there was a linear relationship between absolute residue values and electrophilicity. It was concluded that predictivity in the region of the domain associated with higher electrophilicity, greater potency, and derivatives containing both halo- and nitro-groups is poorer than elsewhere in the domain, and therefore less confidence should be given to those values. Compounds in this region of the domain of the model are associated with the soft-, or pro-electrophilic mechanisms of toxic action. For the second test set, i.e., derivatives outside the structural domain, an examination of absolute residue values revealed that the observed toxicity is typically in excess of that predicted, especially for compounds in the structural space(s) of well-known electrophilic mechanisms of reactive toxicity. Caution is therefore urged in using statistical approaches to account for, and apply confidence to predictions from the applicability domain. An appreciation of the mechanism of toxicity appears to be critical to the determination of the most likely applicability domain.},

In this paper we discuss this important concept, providing details of the development and application of a method to compute the domain of applicability within model descriptor space and structural space as defined by daylight fingerprints. The importance of the domain of applicability is illustrated using five QSAR models generated on plasma protein binding and P450 inhibition datasets.

	Abstract = {ABSTRACT Shape Signatures is a new computational tool that is being evaluated for applications in computational toxicology and drug discovery. The method employs a customized ray-tracing algorithm to explore the volume enclosed by the surface of a molecule and then uses the output to construct compact histograms (i.e., signatures) that encode for molecular shape and polarity. In the present study, we extend the application of the Shape Signatures methodology to the domain of computational models for cardiotoxicity. The Shape Signatures method is used to generate molecular descriptors that are then utilized with widely used classification techniques such as k nearest neighbors (k-NN), support vector machines (SVM), and Kohonen self-organizing maps (SOM). The performances of these approaches were assessed by applying them to a data set of compounds with varying affinity toward the 5-HT2B receptor as well as a set of human ether-a-go-go-related gene (hERG) potassium channel inhibitors. Our classification models for 5-HT2B represented the first attempt at global computational models for this receptor and exhibited average accuracies in the range of 7383%. This level of performance is comparable to using commercially available molecular descriptors. The overall accuracy of the hERG Shape SignaturesSVM models was 6973%, in line with other computational models published to date. Our data indicate that Shape Signatures descriptors can be used with SVM and Kohonen SOM and perform better in classification problems related to the analysis of highly clustered and heterogeneous property spaces. Such models may have utility for predicting the potential for cardiotoxicity in drug discovery mediated by the 5-HT2B receptor and hERG.},

	Abstract = {Targeting the interfaces between proteins has huge therapeutic potential, but discovering small- molecule drugs that disrupt protein - protein interactions is an enormous challenge. Several recent success stories, however, indicate that protein - protein interfaces might be more tractable than has been thought. These studies discovered small molecules that bind with drug- like potencies to 'hotspots' on the contact surfaces involved in protein - protein interactions. Remarkably, these small molecules bind deeper within the contact surface of the target protein, and bind with much higher efficiencies, than do the contact atoms of the natural protein partner. Some of these small molecules are now making their way through clinical trials, so this high-hanging fruit might not be far out of reach.},

Nineteen molecular descriptors of various types (physicochemical, steric, geometrical, and electronic) have been systematically tested through a careful application of MLR. The analysis revealed that the biological activity of these compounds against M. tuberculosis does not depend on lipophilicity, as measured by log P. Properties that account for the biological response of isoniazid and related compounds, consistent with a mechanism involving the formation of radical species, were identified. The role of substituents in the stabilization of the intermediate species that gives rise to the active agent, the acyl radical, is discussed. It is postulated that the activation of INH derivatives' prodrugs (hydrazines and hydrazones) occurs near the surface of M. tuberculosis.},

The effectiveness of signature versus commonly used descriptors in QSAR analysis is demonstrated by correlating the activities of 121 HIV-1 protease inhibitors. Our approach to the inverse-QSAR problem consists of first finding the optimum sets of descriptor values best matching a target activity and then generating a focused library of candidate structures from the solution set of descriptor values. Both steps are facilitated by the use of signature. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.},

Two physical property datasets are applied as case studies of the inverse QSPR workflow (IQW): mean molecular polarizability and aqueous solubility. The case studies demonstrate the optimization of molecular structures to within a property range of interest; the optimized structures are then validated against QSPR models that are generated from sets of alternative descriptors to those used in the IQW.

	Abstract = {A quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) study on 48 peptidic HIV-1 protease inhibitors was performed. Fourteen a priori molecular descriptors were used to build QSAR models. Hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA), principal component analysis (PCA) and partial least squares (PLS) regression were employed. PLS models with 32/16 (model I) and 48/0 (model II) molecules in the training/external validation set were constructed. The a priori molecular descriptors were related to two energetic variables using PLS. HCA and PCA on data from model II classified the inhibitors as slightly, moderately and highly active; three principal components, the chemical nature of which has been highlighted, are enough to describe the enzyme-inhibitor binding. Model I (r(2) = 0.91, q(2) = 0.84) is comparable to literature models obtained by various QSAR softwares, which justified the use of a priori descriptors. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

	Abstract = {A hierarchical model consisting of quantitative structure-activity relationships based mainly on chemical reactivity was developed to predict the carcinogenicity of organic chemicals to rodents. The model is comprised of quantitative structure-activity relationships, QSARs based on hypothesized mechanisms of action, metabolism, and partitioning. Predictors included octanol/water partition coefficient, molecular size, atomic partial charge, bond angle strain, atomic acceptor delocalizibility, atomic radical superdelocalizibility, the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy of hypothesized intermediate nitrenium ion of primary aromatic amines, difference in charge of ionized and unionized carbon-chlorine bonds, substituent size and pattern on polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons, the distance between lone electron pairs over a rigid structure, and the presence of functionalities such as nitroso and hydrazine. The model correctly classified 96\% of the carcinogens in the training set of 306 chemicals, and 90\% of the carcinogens in the test set of 301 chemicals. The test set by chance contained 84\% of the positive thio-containing chemicals. A QSAR for these chemicals was developed. This posttest set modified model correctly predicted 94\% of the carcinogens in the test set. This model was used to predict the carcinogenicity of the 25 organic chemicals the U.S. National Toxicology Program was testing at the writing of this article.},

	Abstract = {Multivariate PCA- and PLS-models involving many variables are often difficult to interpret, because plots and lists of loadings, coefficients, VIPs, etc, rapidly become messy and hard to overview. There may then be a strong temptation to eliminate variables to obtain a smaller data set. Such a reduction of variables, however, often removes information and makes the modelling efforts less reliable. Model interpretation may be misleading and predictive power may deteriorate.

A better alternative is usually to partition the variables into blocks of logically related variables and apply hierarchical data analysis. Such blocked data may be analyzed by PCA and PLS. This modelling forms the base-level of the hierarchical modelling set-up. On the base-level in-depth information is extracted for the different blocks. The score vectors formed on the base-level, here called 'super variables', may be linked together in new matrices on the top-level. On the top-level superficial relationships between the X- and the Y-data are investigated.

In this paper the basic principles of hierarchical modelling by means of PCA and PLS are reviewed. One objective of the paper is to disseminate this concept to a broader QSAR audience. The hierarchical methods are used to analyze a set of 10 haloalkanes for which K = 30 chemical descriptors and M = 255 biological responses have been gathered. Due to the complexity of the biological data, they are sub-divided in four blocks. All the modelling steps on the base-level and the top-level are reported and the final QSAR model is interpreted thoroughly.},

We consider some examples of published QSPR models, which in spite of their high fitted accuracy for the training sets and apparent mechanistic appeal, fail rigorous validation tests, and, thus, may lack practical utility as reliable screening tools. We present a set of simple guidelines for developing validated and predictive QSPR models. To this end, we discuss several validation strategies including (1) randomization of the modelled property, also called Y-scrambling, (2) multiple leave-many-out cross-validations, and (3) external validation using rational division of a dataset into training and test sets. We also highlight the need to establish the domain of model applicability in the chemical space to flag molecules for which predictions may be unreliable, and discuss some algorithms that can be used for this purpose. We advocate the broad use of these guidelines in the development of predictive QSPR models.},

	Abstract = {A 'global' model of hERG K+ channel was built to satisfy three basic criteria for QSAR models in drug discovery: (1) assessment of the applicability domain, (2) assuring that model decisions can be interpreted by medicinal chemists and (3) assessment of model performance after the model was built. A combination of D-optimal onion design and hierarchical partial least squares modelling was applied to construct a global model of hERG blockade in order to maximize the applicability domain of the model and to enhance its interpretability. Additionally, easily interpretable hERG specific fragment-based descriptors were developed. Model performance was monitored, throughout a time period of 15 months, after model implementation. It was found that after this time duration a greater proportion of molecules were outside the model's applicability domain and that these compounds had a markedly higher average prediction error than those from molecules within the model's applicability domain. The model's predictive performance deteriorated within 4 months after building, illustrating the necessity of regular updating of global models within a drug discovery environment.},

	Annote = {Interesting summary of two papers in the same issue describing the localizaton and role of phosphatidylserine and receptors for this lipid. Basically it appears that the occurs in the plasma membrane in an asymmetric fashion. The lipid transduces signals not by metabolism but by its localization behavior.

There are open questions on how the assymetric localization within the plasma membrane of this lipid is mintained.

Also, the presence of the lipid on cell surfaces (i.e., on the opposite side to its usual location) result in phagocytosis, though other signals are also probably involved.

They also mention an interesting process which is used by the vaccinia virus to infect cells and which may be characteristic of virii that have lipid bilayer coating. Since the infected cell it buds from is undergoing apoptosis, the infected cell membrane is scrambled, the budding virus also has its lipid bilayer scrambled, resulting in phosphatidylserine on the cell surface - which encourages other cells to ingest it, as if it were cell undergoing apoptosis

They also note that a natural compound with anti HIV properties binds to phosphatidylserine - implying that HIV requires this lipid for infection - and that the natural product hinders / occludes phosphatidylserine on the viral surface},

	Abstract = {hERG blockade is one of the major toxicological problems in lead structure optimization. Reliable ligand-based in silica models for predicting hERG blockade therefore have considerable potential for saving time and money, as patch-clamp measurements are very expensive and no crystal structures of the hERG-encoded channel are available. Herein we present a predictive QSAR model for hERG blockade that differentiates between specific and nonspecific binding. Specific binders are identified by preliminary pharmacophore scanning. In addition to descriptor-based models for the compounds selected as hitting one of two different pharmocophores, we also use a model for nonspecific binding that reproduces blocking properties of molecules that do not fit either of the two pharmacophores. PLS and SVR models based on interpretable quantum mechanically derived descriptors on a literature dataset of 773 molecules reach overall R-2 values between 0.60 and 0.70 for independent validation sets and R-2 values between 0.39 and 0.76 after partitioning according to the pharmacophore search for the test sets. Our findings suggest that hERG blockade may occur through different types of binding, so that several different models may be necessary to assess hERG toxicity.},

	Abstract = {Blockage of the potassium channel encoded by the human ether-a-go-go related gene (hERG) is well understood to be the root cause of the cardio-toxicity of numerous approved and investigational drugs. As such, a cascade of in vitro and in vivo assays have been developed to filter compounds with hERG inhibitory activity. Quantitative structure activity relationship (QSAR) models are used at the very earliest part of this cascade to eliminate compounds that are likely to have this undesirable activity prior to synthesis. Here a new QSAR technique based on the one-dimensional representation is described in the context of the development of a model to predict hERG inhibition. The model is shown to perform close to the limits of the quality of the data used for model building. In order to make optimal use of the available data, a general robust mathematical scheme was developed and is described to simultaneously incorporate quantitative data, such as IC50 = 50 nM, and qualitative data, such as inactive or IC50 > 30 mu M into QSAR models without discarding any experimental information.},

	Abstract = {Modelling of in vitro human serum albumin (HSA) binding data of 94 diverse drugs and drug-like compounds is performed to develop global predictive models that are applicable to the whole medicinal chemistry space. For this aim, ant colony systems, a stochastic method along with multiple linear regression (MLR), is employed to exhaustively search and select multivariate linear equations, from a pool of 327 molecular descriptors. This methodology helped us to derive optimal quantitative structure property relationship (QSPR) models based on five and six descriptors with excellent predictive power. The best five-descriptor model is based on Kier and Hall valence connectivity index-Order 5 (path), Auto-correlation descriptor (Broto-Moreau) weighted by atomic masses-Order 4, Auto-correlation descriptor (Broto-Moreau) weighted by atomic polarizabilities-Order 5, AlogP98, SklogS (calculated buffer water solubility) [R = 0.8942, Q = 0.86790, F = 62,24 and SE = 0.2626]; the best six-variable model is based on Kier and Hall valence connectivity index of Order 3 (cluster), Auto-correlation descriptor (Broto-Moreau) weighted by atomic masses-Order 4, Auto-correlation descriptor (Broto-Moreau) weighted by atomic polarizabilities-Order 5, Atomic-Level- Based AI topological descriptors-AldsCH, AlogP98, SklogS (calculated buffer water solubility) [R = 0.9128, Q = 0.89220, F = 64.09 and SE = 0.2411]. From the analysis of the physical meaning of the selected descriptors, it is inferred that the binding affinity of small organic compounds to human serum albumin is principally dependent on the following fundamental properties: (1) hydrophobic interactions, (2) solubility, (3) size and (4) shape. Finally, as the models reported herein are based on computed properties, they appear to be a valuable tool in virtual screening, where selection and prioritisation of candidates is required.

The models complement one another and have identified the following descriptors as important features for CYP1A2 inhibition; lipophilicity, aromaticity, charge, and the HOMO/LUMO energies. Furthermore all models are global and have been used to predict a diverse independent set of compounds. For the first time in the field of QSAR, the K index of agreement has comprehensively been used to assess the overall accuracy of the model's predictive power.

Thus, an increased emphasis on thorough ADMET (absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion and toxicity) studies based on in vitro and in silico approaches allows for early evaluation of new drugs in the development phase. Artificial membrane permeability measurements afford a high throughput, relatively low cost but labor intensive alternative for in vitro determination of drug absorption potential; parallel artificial membrane permeability assays have been extensively utilized to determine drug absorption potentials.

	Abstract = {In-silico models were generated to predict the extent of inhibition of cytochrome P450 isoenzymes using a set of relatively interpretable descriptors in conjunction with partial least squares (PLS) and regression trees (RT). The former was chosen due to the conservative nature of the resultant models built and the latter to more effectively account for any non-linearity between dependent and independent variables. All models are statistically significant and agree with the known SAR and they could be used as a guide to P450 liability through a classification based on the continuous pIC50 prediction given by the model. A compound is classified as having either a high or low P450 liability if the predicted pIC(50) is at least one root mean square error (RMSE) from the high/low pIC(50) cut-off of 5. If predicted within an RMSE of the cut-off we cannot be confident a compound will be experimentally low or high so an indeterminate classification is given. Hybrid models using bulk descriptors and fragmental descriptors do significantly better in modeling CYP450 inhibition, than bulk property QSAR descriptors alone.},

	Abstract = {Cytochromes P450 3A4, 2D6, and 2C9 metabolize a large fraction of drugs. Knowing where these enzymes will preferentially oxidize a molecule, the regioselectivity, allows medicinal chemists to plan how best to block its metabolism. We present QSAR-based regioselectivity models for these enzymes calibrated against compiled literature data of drugs and drug-like compounds. These models are purely empirical and use only the structures of the substrates, in contrast to those models that simulate a specific mechanism like hydrogen radical abstraction, and/or use explicit models of active sites. Our most predictive models use three substructure descriptors and two physical property descriptors. Descriptor importances from the random forest QSAR method show that other factors than the immediate chemical environment and the accessibility of the hydrogen affect regioselectivity in all three isoforms. The cross-validated predictions of the models are compared to predictions from our earlier mechanistic model (Singh et al. J. Med. Chem. 2003, 46, 1330-1336) and predictions from MetaSite (Cruciani et al. J. Med. Chem. 2005, 48, 6970-6979).},

	Abstract = {A novel N-{2-amino-4-methyl[(pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidin-5-yl)ethyl]benzoyl}-L-glutamic acid (3a) was designed and synthesized as a potent dual inhibitor of thymidylate synthase (TS) and dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) and as an antitumor agent. Compound 3b, the N7-benzylated analogue of 3a, was also synthesized as an antitumor agent. The synthesis of 3a was accomplished via a 12-step sequence which involved the synthesis of 2-amino-4-methylpyrrolo-[2,3-d]pyrimidine (10) in 5 steps from 2-acetylbutyrolactone. Protection of the 2-amino group of 10 and regioselective iodination at the 5-position followed by palladium-catalyzed coupling afforded intermediate 14 which was converted to 3a by reduction and saponification. Similar synthetic methodology was used for 3b. X-ray crystal structure of the ternary complex of 3a, DHFR, and NADPH showed that the pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidine ring binds in a "2,4-diamino mode" in which the pyrrole nitrogen mimics the 4-amino moiety of 2,4-diaminopyrimidines. This is the first example of a classical pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidine antifolate shown to have this alternate mode of binding to DHFR. Compounds 3a and 3b were more inhibitory than LY231514 against TS from Lactobacillus casei and Escherichia coli. Analogue 3a was also more inhibitory against DHFR from human, Toxoplasma gondii, and Pneumocystis carinii. Evaluation of 3a against methotrexate (MTX)-resistant cell lines with defined mechanisms indicated that cross-resistance of 3a was much lower than that of MTX. Metabolite protection studies and folylpoly-gamma -glutamate synthetase studies suggest that the antitumor activity of 3a against the growth of tumor cells in culture is a result of dual inhibition of TS and DHFR. Compound 3a inhibited the growth of CCRF-CEM and FaDu cells in culture at ED50 values of 12.5 and 7.0 nM, respectively, and was more active against FaDu cells than MTX. In contrast, compound 3b was inactive against both cell lines. Compound 3a was evaluated in the National Cancer Institute in vitro preclinical antitumor screening program and afforded IG(50) values in the nanomolar range against a number of tumor cell lines.},

The potent inhibitors 6-([5-quinolylamino]methyl)-2,4-diamino-5-methylpyrido[2,3d]pyrimidine (SRI-9439) and (Z)-6-(2-[2,5-dimethoxyphenyl]ethen-1-yl)2,4-diamino-5-methylpyrido[2,3-d]pyrimidine (SRI-9662) were developed at Southern Research Institute against Toxoplasma gondii DHFR-thymidylate synthase. The 5-deazapteridine ring of each inhibitor adopts an unusual puckered conformation that enables the formation of identical contacts in the active site. Conversely, the quinoline and dimethoxybenzene moieties exhibit distinct binding characteristics that account for the differences in inhibitory activity. In both structures, a salt-bridge is formed between Arg70 in the active site and Glu44 from a symmetry-related molecule in the crystal lattice that mimics the binding of methotrexate to DHFR.

In this work, we identify 1,4-bis-{[N-(1-imino-1-guanidino-methyl)]sulfanylmethyl}-3,6-dimethyl-benzene (compound 1) as the correct structure of the previously reported DHFR inhibitor 1,4-bis-{(iminothioureidomethyl)aminomethyl}-3,6-dimethyl-benzene (compound 2). The fact that compound 1 has an uncharacteristic structure for DHFR inhibitors, and an affinity (KI of 11.5 nM) comparable to potent inhibitors such as methotrexate and trimethoprim, made this inhibitor of interest for further analysis. We have conducted a characterization of the primary interactions of compound 1 and DHFR using a combination of X-ray structure and SAR analysis. The crystal structure of E. coli DHFR in complex with compound 1 and NADPH reveals that one portion of this inhibitor exploits a unique binding surface, the M20 loop. The importance of this interface was further confirmed by SAR analysis and additional structural characterization.},

Structural features describing the database were used to differentiate the chemical spaces of drugs/candidates, food ingredients, and industrial chemicals. In general, structures for drugs/candidates and food ingredients are associated with lower frequencies of mutagenicity and clastogenicity, whereas industrial chemicals as a group contain a much higher proportion of positives. Structural features were selected to analyze endpoint outcomes of the genetic toxicity studies. Although most of the well-known genotoxic carcinogenic alerts were identified, some discrepancies from the classic Ashby-Tennant alerts were observed. Using these influential features as the independent variables, the results of four types of genotoxicity studies were correlated. High Pearson correlations were found between the results of <i>Salmonella</i> mutagenicity and mouse lymphoma assay testing as well as those from in vitro chromosome aberration studies. This paper demonstrates the usefulness of representing a chemical by its structural features and the use of these features to profile a battery of tests rather than relying on a single toxicity test of a given chemical. This paper presents data mining/profiling methods applied in a weight-of-evidence approach to assess potential for genetic toxicity, and to guide the development of intelligent testing strategies.},

	Abstract = {Abstract: A novel method for quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) analysis is presented. The method, which does not assume any particular functional form for the QSAR, develops nonlinear relationships between parameters describing a set of molecules and the activity of the molecules. For the QSAR of the inhibition of Escherichia coli dihydrofolate reductase by 2,4-diamino-5-(substituted benzyl)pyrimidines, the method compares favorably to other nonlinear methods. Cross-validation trials demonstrate that the predictive ability is as accurate as other methods, and the method is simpler and faster than neural network and machine-learning methods. Consequently, its implementation is much easier, and interpretation of the generated QSAR is more straightforward.},

	Abstract = {The paper describes the design, synthesis, and testing of inhibitors of folate-synthesizing enzymes and of whole cell cultures of Candida albicans. The target enzymes used were dihydropteroic acid synthase (SYN) and dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR). Several series of new 2,4-diaminopyrimidines were synthesized and tested as inhibitors of DHFR and compared with their activity against DHFR derived from mycobacteria and Escherichia coli. To test for selectivity, also rat DHFR was used. A series of substituted 4-aminodiphenyl sulfones was tested for inhibitory activity against SYN and the I-50 values compared to those obtained previously against Plasmodium berghei- and E. coli-derived SYN. Surprisingly, QSAR equations show very similar structural dependencies. To find an explanation for the large difference in the I-50 values observed for enzyme inhibition (SYN, DHFR) and for inhibition of cell cultures of Candida, mutant strains with overexpressed efflux pumps and strains in which such pumps are deleted were included in the study and the MICs compared. Efflux pumps were responsible for the low activity of some of the tested derivatives, others showed no increase in activity after pumps were knocked out. In this case it may be speculated that these derivatives are not able to enter the cells.},

QSAR models, dealing with different biological responses (IC90, IC50 and ED90) of the parasite Plasmodium Falciparum, are constructed using MQSM as molecular descriptors and are satisfactorily correlated. The statistical results of the 20 1,2,4-trioxanes are deeply analyzed to elucidate the relevant structural features in the biological activity, revealing the importance of phenyl substitutions.},

	Abstract = {Arternisinin derivatives with antimalarial activity against Plasmodium falciparum resistant to mefloquine are designed with the aid of Quantum Chemical and Partial Least Squares Methods. The PLS model with three principal components explaining 89.55\% of total variance, Q(2) = 0.83 and R-2 = 0.92 was obtained for 14/5 molecules in the training/external validation set. The most important descriptors for the design of the model were one level above the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital energy (LUMO+1), atomic charges in atoms C9 and C11 (Q(9)) and (Q(11)) respectively, the maximum number of hydrogen atoms that might make contact with heme (NH) and RDF030 m (a radial distribution function centered at 3.0 Angstrom interatomic distance and weighted by atomic masses). From a set of ten proposed artemisinin derivatives, a new compound (26), was predicted with antimalarial activity higher than the compounds reported in literature. Molecular graphics and modeling supported the PLS results and revealed heme-ligand and protein-ligand stereoelectronic relationships as important for antimalarial activity. The most active 26 and 29 in the prediction set possess substituents at C9 able to extend to hemoglobin exterior, what determines the high activity of these compounds.},

The antimalarial activity [-log(IC(50)x10(6))] of the compounds studied were well correlated with descriptors encoding the chemical structure. Using the pertinent descriptors revealed by a stepwise procedure in the multiple linear regression technique, a correlation coefficient of 0.9394 (s=0.2121) for the training set was obtained for the ANN model in a [3-5-1] configuration. The results show that the antimalarial activity of 2-aziridinyl and 2,3-bis(aziridinyl)-1,4-naphthoquinonyl sulfonate and acylate derivatives is strongly dependent on hydrophobic character, hydrogen-bond acceptors and also steric factors of the substituents.},

	Abstract = {Malaria is nowadays a worldwide and serious problem with a significant social, economic, and human cost, mainly in developing countries. In addition, the emergence and spread of resistance to existing antimalarial therapies deteriorate the global malaria situation, and lead thus to an urgent need toward the design and discovery of new antimalarial drugs. In this work, a QSAR predictive model based on GETAWAY descriptors was developed which is able to explain with, only three variables, more than 77\% of the variance in antimalarial potency and displays a good internal predictive ability (of 73.3\% and 72.9\% from leave-one-out cross-validation and bootstrapping analyses, respectively). The performance of the proposed model was judged against other five methodologies providing evidence of the superiority of GETAWAY descriptors in predicting the antimalarial potency of the bisbenzamidine family. Moreover, a desirability analysis based on the final QSAR model showed that to be a useful way of selecting the predictive variable level necessary to obtain potent bisbenzamidines. From the proposed model it is also possible to infer that elevated high atomic masses/polarizabilities/van der Waals volumes could play a negative/positive/positive role in the molecular interactions responsible for the desired drug conformation, which is required for the optimal binding to the macromolecular target. The results obtained point out that our final QSAR model is statistically significant and robust as well as possessing a high predictive effectiveness. Thus, the model provides a feasible and practical tool for looking for new and potent antimalarial bisbenzamidines. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	Abstract = {The present Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationships (QSAR) study attempts to explore the structural and physicochemical requirements of O-[2-(phthalimido)ethyl]substituted-phenylthiocarbamates for cytoprotection data from MT-4-based assays using a Linear Free Energy Related (LFER) model of Hansch. QSAR models have been developed using electronic (Hammett sigma), hydrophobicity (pi) and steric (molar refractivity and STERIMOL L, B-1, and B-5) parameters of phenyl ring substituents of the compounds along with appropriate dummy variables. Statistical techniques like stepwise regression, Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) with Factor Analysis (FA) as the data preprocessing step (FA-MLR), Partial Least Squares (PLS), Principal Component Regression (PCR), Multiple Linear Regression with Genetic Function Approximation (GFA-MLR) and Genetic Partial Least Squares (G/PLS) model were applied to identify the structural and physicochemical requirements for the cytoprotection activity. The generated equations were statistically validated using leave-one-out technique. The quality of equations obtained from these techniques were of acceptable statistical qualities (explained variance ranging from 57.7 to 75.9\%, while predicted variance ranging from 53.2 to 68.5\%), while the best model came from the PLS technique. The PLS equation with variables selected based on standardized regression coefficients show explained and predicted variances of 75.9 and 68.1\%, respectively, and the G/PLS explained and predicted variances of 75.1 and 68.5\%, respectively, of the cytoprotection activity data. Both stepwise regression and GFA derived models show high intercorrelation among predictor variables used in the equations, while the FA-MLR derived model has comparatively lower statistical quality. The best models were also subjected to leave-25\%-out crossvalidation. The results of the present QSAR study are in agreement with the observations of the previously reported docking experiment of thiocarbamate derivatives.},

	Abstract = {Artificial neural networks (ANNs) were used to model both inhibition of HIV-1 protease (K-i) and inhibition of HIV replication (IC90) for 55 Cyclic Urea derivatives using constitutional and 2D descriptors. As a preliminary step, linear dependences were established by multiple linear regression (MLR) approaches, selecting the relevant descriptors by genetic algorithm (GA) feature selection. For ANN models non-linear GA feature selection was also applied. Non-linear modeling of K-i overcame the results of the linear one using four properties, keeping in mind standard Pearson R correlation coefficients (0.931 vs. 0.862) and leave one out (LOO) cross-validation analysis (Q(LOO)(2) = 0.703 vs. 0.510). Oil the other hand, IC90 modeling was insoluble by a linear L approach: no predictive model was achieved; however, a non-linear relation was encountered according to statistic results (R = 0.891; Q(LOO)(2) = 0.568). The best non-linear models suggested the influence of the presence of nitrogen atoms and the molecular Volume distribution in the inhibitor structures oil the HIV-1 protease inhibition as well as that the inhibition of HIV replication was dependent on the occurrence of five-member rings. Finally, inhibitors were well distributed regarding its activity levels in a Kohonen self-organizing map built using the input variables of the best non-linear models. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

@article{Tang:2007aa,
	Abstract = {The support vector machine (SVM) has been receiving increasing interest in an area of QSAR study for its ability in function approximation and remarkable generalization performance. However, selection of support vectors and intensive optimization of kernel width of a nonlinear SVM are inclined to get trapped into local optima, leading to an increased risk of underfitting or overfitting. To overcome these problems, a new nonlinear SVM algorithm is proposed using adaptive kernel transform based on a radial basis function network (RBFN) as optimized by particle swarm optimization (PSO). The new algorithm incorporates a nonlinear transform of the original variables to feature space via a RBFN with one input and one hidden layer. Such a transform intrinsically yields a kernel transform of the original variables. A synergetic optimization of all parameters including kernel centers and kernel widths as well as SVM model coefficients using PSO enables the determination of a flexible kernel transform according to the performance of the total model. The implementation of PSO demonstrates a relatively high efficiency in convergence to a desired optimum. Applications of the proposed algorithm to QSAR studies of binding affinity of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase inhibitors and activity of 1-phenylbenzimidazoles reveal that the new algorithm provides superior performance to the backpropagation neural network and a conventional nonlinear SVM, indicating that this algorithm holds great promise in nonlinear SVM learning.},

The measurements performed later turned out to agree with the predictions.},

	Abstract = {A theoretical model has been developed that discriminates between active and nonactive drugs against HIV-1 with four different mechanisms of action for the active drugs. The model was built up using a probabilistic neural network (PNN) algorithm and a database of 2720 compounds. The model showed an overall accuracy of 97.34\% in the training series, 85.12\% in the selection series, and 84.78\% in an external prediction series. The model not only correctly classified a very heterogeneous series of organic compounds but also discriminated between very similar active/nonactive chemicals that belong to the same family of compounds. More specifically, the model recognized 96.02\% of nonactive compounds, 94.24\% of active compounds that inhibited reverse transcriptase, 97.24\% of protease inhibitors, 97.14\% of virus uncoating inhibitors, and 90.32\% of integrase inhibitors. The results indicate that this approach may represent a powerful tool for modeling large databases in QSAR with applications in medicinal chemistry.},

It is an essential enzyme required for replication of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) virus. Caffeoyl naphthalene sulfonamide derivatives act against HIV integrase and thus have the potential to become a part of an anti-HlV drug regimen. Although caffeoyl naphthalene sulfonamide derivatives have all the features required of good anti-HIV agents such as the presence of bis-catechol moieties, polyaromatic rings, and a central linker, they do

QSAR reveals that if partition coefficient, connectivity index, and shape index of these molecules are altered, the activity is likely to increase. On the basis of the QSAR model, we designed a new series of compounds, calculated the activities, and found that they were more potent than the existing compounds.},

	Abstract = {Abstract: The use of tetrahydropyrimidinones as an alternate scaffold for designing HIVPR inhibitors has advantages, over the previously disclosed hexahydro-1,3-diazepin-2-ones, of being more unsymmetrical (different P1/P1'), less crystalline, more soluble, and more lipophilic (mono-ol vs diol). They show a better translation of Ki to IC90 for the more polar P2 groups that in general give the more potent enzyme inhibitors. Structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies of the tetrahydropyrimidinones showed that the phenylethyl P1' substituent, the hydroxyl group, and the urea carbonyl are all critical for good activity. However, there was significant flexibility in the possible P2/P2' substituents that could be used. Many analogues that contained identical or different P2/P2' substituents, or only one P2 substituent, were found to have excellent enzyme potency and several had excellent antiviral potency. Several of these compounds were examined for oral bioavailability in the rat or the dog at 10 mg/kg. However, the oral bioavailability of the tetrahydropyrimidinones was, in general, less than the corresponding hexahydro-1,3-diazepin-2-ones. Unfortunately, when all factors are considered, including potency, protein binding, solubility, bioavailability, and resistance profile, the tetrahydropyrimidinones did not offer any advantage over the previously disclosed hexahydro-1,3-diazepin-2-ones series.},

	Abstract = {In pursuit of better anti-HIV drugs, quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) studies were performed on a series of aryl sulfonamide HIV protease inhibitors using Win CAChe 6.1. Multiple linear regression analysis was performed to derive QSAR models, which were further evaluated for statistical significance and predictive power by internal and external validation. The QSAR model indicates that the thermodynamic descriptors (heat of formation, log P, and molar refractivity) and steric descriptor (solvent assessable surface area) play an important role for the anti-HIV activity. The results of the present study may be useful on the designing of more potent anti-HIV agents.},

	Abstract = {We introduce the notion of structure-activity landscape index (SALI) curves as a way to assess a model and a modeling protocol, applied to structure-activity relationships. We start from our earlier work [J. Chem. Inf. Model., 2008, 48, 646-658], where we show how to study a structure-activity relationship pairwise, based on the notion of "activity cliffs" - pairs of molecules that are structurally similar but have large differences in activity. There, we also introduced the SALI parameter, which allows one to identify cliffs easily, and which allows one to represent a structure-activity relationship as a graph. This graph orders every pair of molecules by their activity. Here, we introduce the new idea of a SALI curve, which tallies how many of these orderings a model is able to predict. Empirically, testing these SALI curves against a variety of models, ranging over two-dimensional quantitative structure-activity relationship (2D-QSAR), three-dimensional quantitative structure-activity relationship (3D-QSAR), and structure-based design models, the utility of a model seems to correspond to characteristics of these curves. In particular, the integral of these curves, denoted as SCI and being a number ranging from -1.0 to 1.0, approaches a value of 1.0 for two literature models, which are both known to be prospectively useful.},

Models with excellent predictive capability have been obtained for amines, chlorobenzenes, organotin compounds and organophosphorous pesticides. Moreover, a more general model has been produced for the whole, highly heterogeneous, set of 49 compounds. The resulting 7-variable equation accounts for 75\% of the variability of the toxic effect, over a range of more than 7 logarithmic units, and the model has been externally validated with success. Some attempts are made here to interpret the toxicological mode of action of the chemicals in function of molecular features described by the indices. (C) 1996 Elsevier Science Ltd.},

	Abstract = {The inhibitory activity values (IC50) Of 54 phenyltropanes at the DA, 5-HT and NA transporters were quantitatively examined by use of different QSAR-techniques and PLS-1. All models were validated via leave-one-out cross-validation. In addition, the 2D and 3D QSAR analyses were externally validated with a test set of 8 compounds based on design considerations. Free-Wilson analyses comprising all 62 compounds revealed the presence of a homogenous data set and a linear SAR for the above-mentioned transporters. Application of a VIP-guided variable selection procedure on an X-matrix containing 36 physicochemical and quantum mechanical parameters resulted in informative 2D models that were simple to interpret. For purpose of comparison additional CoMFA models using the standard fields were constructed from a molecular alignment maximizing the similarity of molecular shape and electrostatic potential. Highly significant models with good fitting and predictive abilities were developed for each transporter, The major structural requirements revealed from the CoMFA analyses were in good agreement with the findings of the individual 2D analyses. Whereas the DA and NA transporters are sensitive to steric bulk arising from the 3 beta-phenyl ring, large substituents R-2 in position C2 of the tropane ring or a N-methyl group instead of a hydrogen decrease binding affinity to the NA and 5-HT transporters. The models obtained suggest a close similarity between the examined transporters in terms of binding interaction. A comparison of the CoMFA contour maps provides a rational basis for the design of selective ligands.},

However, a nonlinear relationship between toxicity and one of the molecular descriptors in the response surface model was observed. In this study, response surface models were established using six nonlinear modeling methods to handle the nonlinearity exhibited in the aromatic chemicals data set. All models were validated using the method of cross-validation, and prediction accuracy was tested on an external data set. Results showed that response surface models based on locally weighted regression scatter plot smoothing (LOESS), multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS), neural networks (NN), and projection pursuit regression (PPR) provided satisfactory power of model fitting and prediction and had similar applicabilities. The response surface models based on nonlinear methods were difficult to interpret and conservative in discriminating toxicity mechanisms.},

The major disadvantage for surface-based descriptors is that they are difficult to interpret in the sense of relating predictions to the chemical composition of the molecule.

Contrary to the original. relatively nonspecific descriptor set, which included, for example, a number of topological descriptors, specific structural descriptors that are much easier to interpret from a medicinal chemical point of view are used in this multiple linear regression-based approach. Only statistically significant descriptors have been retained in the final equation, and whereas they give about the same correlation as those of the original paper on the training set (r(2) of 0.79 vs. 0.76, n = 49), they perform much better on the test set (predictive r(pr)(2) of 0.73 vs. 0.05; r(2) of 0.78 vs. 0.08, n = 12). Descriptors found to be relevant are clearly related to substitutions at known pharmacophore positions, such as those corresponding to the 2,3-, 7,8- and 4'-positions of the benzodiazepine skeleton. Therefore, by a more careful selection of the descriptor set, both an improved prediction and a more intuitive quantitative interpretation could be achieved for this set of allosteric AMPA antagonists.},

It was demonstrated that polarizability anisotropy and mean polarizability could change sensitively and systematically with chlorine number and substitution pattern. And new quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSARs) focused on the binding affinities of aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase (AHH) and 7-ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase (EROD) induction potencies of PCDFs were developed. It was concluded that polarizability anisotropy in conjunction with hyperpolarizabilties and hyper-order electric moments, e.g. octupole moments could well interpret the variation of toxicity of different congeners and dispersion interaction should be the leading form among various interactions. Although the terms of hyperpolarizabilities and hyper-order electric moments were not the same significant ones as polarizability anisotropy, the long-range interactions characterized by them should not be ignored in explaining the toxicity.

@article{Horvath:2007aa,
	Abstract = {Descriptor selection in QSAR typically relies on a set of upfront working hypotheses in order to boil down the initial descriptor set to a tractable size. Stepwise regression, computationally cheap and therefore widely used in spite of its potential caveats, is most aggressive in reducing the effectively explored problem space by adopting a greedy variable pick strategy. This work explores an antipodal approach, incarnated by an original Genetic Algorithm ( GA)-based Stochastic QSAR Sampler ( SQS) that favors unbiased model search over computational cost. Independent of a priori descriptor filtering and, most important, not limited to linear models only, it was benchmarked against the ISIDA Stepwise Regression ( SR) tool. SQS was run under various premises, varying the training/validation set splitting scheme, the nonlinearity policy, and the used descriptors. With the considered three anti-HIV compound sets, repeated SQS runs generate sometimes poorly overlapping but nevertheless equally well validating model sets. Enabling SQS to apply nonlinear descriptor transformations increases the problem space: nevertheless, nonlinear models tend to be more robust validators. Model validation benchmarking showed SQS to match the performance of SR or outperform it in cases when the upfront simplifications of SR "backfire", even though the robust SR got trapped in local minima only once in six cases. Consensus models from large SQS model sets validate well-but not outstandingly better than SR consensus equations. SQS is thus a robust QSAR building tool according to standard validation tests against external sets of compounds ( of same families as used for training), but many of its benefits/drawbacks may yet not be revealed by such tests. SQS results are a challenge to the traditional way to interpret and exploit QSAR: how to deal with thousands of well validating models, nonetheless providing potentially diverging applicability ranges and predicted values for external compounds. SR does not impose such burden on the user, but is "betting" on a single equation or a narrow consensus model to behave properly in virtual screening a sound strategy? By posing these questions, this article will hopefully act as an incentive for the long-haul studies needed to get them answered.},

	Abstract = {Chemical carcinogenicity is of primary interest because it drives much of the current regulatory actions regarding new and existing chemicals and conventional experimental tests take around 3 years to design, conduct, and interpret in addition to costing hundreds of millions of dollars, millions of skilled personnel hours, and millions of animal lives. Thus, theoretical approaches such as the one proposed here, quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR), are increasingly used for assessing the risks of environmental chemicals, since they can markedly reduce costs, avoid animal testing, and speed up policy decisions. This paper reports a QSAR study based on the TOPological Substructural MOlecular DEsign (TOPS-MODE) approach, aimed at predicting the rodent carcinogenicity of a set of nitroso compounds selected from the Carcinogenic Potency Data Base (CPDB). The set comprises 26 nitroso compounds, divided into N-nitrosoureas, N-nitrosamines, and C-nitroso compounds, which have been bioassayed in female rats using gavage as a route of administration. Here, we are especially concerned in discerning the role of structural parameters on the carcinogenic activity of this family of compounds. First, the regression model derived, upon removal of two identified nitrosamine outliers, is able to account for more than 86\% of the variance in the experimental activity. Second, TOPS-MODE afforded the bond contributions (expressed as fragment contributions to the carcinogenic activity) that can be interpreted and provided tools for better understanding of the mechanisms of carcinogenesis. Finally and, most importantly, we demonstrate the potential use of this approach toward the recognition of structural alerts for carcinogenicity predictions.},

	Abstract = {Abstract: The program SEAL is suited to describe the electrostatic, steric, hydrophobic, and hydrogen bond donor and acceptor similarity of different molecules in a quantitative manner. Similarity scores AF can be calculated for pairs of molecules, using either a certain molecular property or a sum of weighted properties. Alternatively, their mutual similarity can be derived from distances d or covariances c between SEAL-based property fields that are calculated in a regular grid. For a set of N chemically related molecules, such values form an N x N similarity matrix which can be correlated with biological activities, using either regression analysis and an appropriate variable selection procedure or partial least-squares (PLS) analysis. For the Cramer steroid data set, the test set predictivities (r2pred = 0.53-0.84) of different PLS models, based on a weighted sum of molecular properties, are superior to published results of CoMFA and CoMSIA studies (r2pred = 0.31-0.40), regardless of whether a common alignment or individual, pairwise alignments of all molecules are used in the calculation of the similarity matrices. Training and test set selections have a significant influence on the external predictivities of the models. Although the SEAL similarity score between two molecules is a single number, its value is based on the 3D properties of both molecules. The term 3D quantitative similarity-activity analyses (3D QSiAR) is proposed for approaches which correlate 3D structure-derived similarity matrices with biological activities.},

	Abstract = {Abstract: A range of good quality, local QSARs for mutagenicity and carcinogenicity have been assessed and challenged for their predictivity in respect to real external test sets (i.e., chemicals never considered by the authors while developing their models). The QSARs for potency (applicable only to toxic chemicals) generated predictions 3070% correct, whereas the QSARs for discriminating between active and inactive chemicals were 70100% correct in their external predictions: thus the latter can be used with good reliability for applicative purposes. On the other hand internal, statistical validation methods, which are often assumed to be good diagnostics for predictivity, did not correlate well with the predictivity of the QSARs when challenged in external prediction tests. Nonlocal models for noncongeneric chemicals were considered as well, pointing to the critical role of an adequate definition of the applicability domain.},

@article{Tian:2007aa,
	Abstract = {Quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) study, important in drug design, mainly involves two aspects, molecular structural characterization (MSC) and construction of a statistical model. MSC focuses on transforming molecular structural and property characteristics into a group of numerical codes, dedicated to minimizing information loss during this process. In this context, common atoms in organic compounds are classified according to their families in the periodic table, and hybridization states, and on the basis of these, three nonbonding interactions (i.e. electrostatic, van der Waals and hydrophobic) are calculated, ultimately resulting in a new rotation-translation invariant, 3D-MSC, as a three-dimensional holograph vector of atomic interaction field (3D-HoVAIF). By applying 3D-HoVAIF to QSAR studies on two classical peptides including 58 angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and 48 bitter-tasting dipeptides, we get two excellent genetic algorithm-partial least squares (GA-PLS) models, with statistics r(2), q(2), root mean square error (RMSEE), and root mean square error of cross-validation (RMSCV) of 0.857, 0.811, 0.376, and 0.432 for ACE inhibitors and 0.940, 0.892, 0.153 and 0.205 for bitter-tasting dipeptides, respectively. By equally dividing the two datasets into training and test sets by D-optimal, the 3D-HoVAIF approach undergoes rigorous statistical validation. Furthermore, the superior performance of 3D-HoVAIF is confirmed in comparison with two other peptide MSC approaches referring to z-scale and ISA-ECI For 58 ACE inhibitors, the GA-PLS model yields two principal components, with the following statistics: r(2) = 0.893, q(2) =0.824, RMSEE = 0.349, RMSCV = 0.425, q(ext)(2) = 0.739, r(ext)(2) = 0.784, r(0.ext)(2) = 0.781, r(0.ext)('2) = 0.779, k = 0.962, k'= 1.019, and RMSEP = 0.460; for 48 bitter-tasting dipeptides, three principal components resulted, with the statistics as: r(2) = 0.950, q(2) = 0.893, RMSEE = 0. 152, PMSCV = 0.222, q(ext)(2) = 0.875, r(ext)(2) = 0.919, r(0.ext)(2) = 0.919, r(0.ext)('2) = 0.919, k = 1.018, k'= 0.974, and RMSEP = 0. 198. In addition, the relationship of ACE-inhibiting activities with bitter-tasting thresholds has been investigated by applying the above-constructed models to predictions on 400 theoretically possible dipeptides. Through analysis, the ACE-inhibiting activities are found to be prominently related to bitter-tasting intensities. Thus, it is deemed to be difficult to find such dipeptides that simultaneously satisfy pharmacodynamic action (high ACE-inhibiting activities) and comfortable tastes, suggesting that active components of dipeptides that are served as functional food to lower blood pressure are not very ideal.

	Abstract = {Extensive 3D-QSAR studies were performed on 158 diverse analogues of 3-pyridyl ethers, which are excellent ligands of alpha 4 beta 2 neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (NnAChR). Comparative molecular field analysis (CoMFA) and comparative molecular similarity indices analysis (CoMSIA) techniques were used to relate the binding affinities with the ligand structures. Two QSAR models were obtained using CoMFA and CoMSIA techniques. The two QSAR models were proved to be statistically significant and have high predictive power. The best CoMFA model yielded the cross-validated q(2) = 0.605 and the non-cross-validated r(2) = 0.862. The derived model indicated the importance of steric (85.9\%) as well as electrostatic (14.1\%) contributions. The CoMFA model demonstrated the steric field as the major descriptor of the ligand binding. The best CoMSIA model gave q(2) = 0.723 and r(2) = 0.685. This model showed that steric (30.3\%) and H-bond interaction (61.8\%) properties played major roles in ligand binding process. The squares of correlation coefficient for external test set of 28 molecules were 0.723 and 0.685 for the CoMFA model and the CoMSIA model, respectively. The two models were further graphically interpreted in terms of field contribution maps. SAR studies were also performed on different series of compounds in order to get a more reasonable understanding of the interactions between the ligands and the receptor. With the results, we have also presumed some assistant elements as supplements to the traditional pharmacophoric elements. A crude vision of ligand localization in the ligand-binding pocket of the receptor was also obtained, which would favor for the docking study of this kind of ligands. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

	Abstract = {Abstract: Many topological indices lack an interpretation in terms of simple physicochemical quantities. We have reexamined the structural interpretation of well-known topological indices: the connectivity index 1, the Wiener index W, and the Hosoya topological index Z. We relate the success of various indices in structure-property studies to the degree to which they differentiate contributions from more exposed terminal bonds and more buried interior bonds. When considering bond additive properties of alkanes we find better regressions when greater weights are assigned to terminal CC bonds and lesser weights to internal CC. We suggest here that topological indices be discussed in terms of their partitioning into bond contributions, which for different indices and different bonds will assume different values. With this insight we modified the Wiener index W into a new index W*, in which bond contributions are determined using the reciprocal of the product of the number of atoms on each side of a bond. Similarly we modified the Hosoya index Z into Z* in which the frequency of occurrence of individual CC bonds in the patterns of disjoint bonds are considered. Novel indices are compared with other indices and they show to yield better regressions for boiling points of octane isomers. This suggests a useful classification of topological indices based on the relative magnitudes of the contributions of terminal and interior bonds. To extend such considerations to other indices one needs to consider partitioning of global molecular indices into bond additive terms. A general scheme for partitioning of molecular descriptors into bond contributions is outlined for indices derived from a selection of matrices associated with molecular graphs.},

	Abstract = {Abstract: Precise thermodynamic integration free energy simulations have been applied to a congeneric series of 16 inhibitors to the p38 MAP kinase protein for which the experimental binding data (IC50) is known. The relative free energy of binding for each compound has been determined. For comparison, the same series of compounds have also scored using the best rapid scoring functions used in database screening. From the results of these calculations, we find (1) that precise free energy simulations allow predictions that are reliable and in good agreement with experiment; (2) that predictions of lower reliability, but still in good qualitative agreement with experiment, can be obtained using the OWFEG free energy grid method, at a much lower computational cost; (3) and that other methods, not based on free energy simulations yield results in much poorer agreement with experiment. A new predictive index, which measures the reliability of a prediction method in the context of normal use, is defined and calculated for each scoring method. Predictive indices of 0.84, 0.56, 0.04, -0.05, and 0.25 are calculated for thermodynamic integration, OWFEG, ChemScore, PLPScore, and Dock Energy Score, respectively, where +1.0 is perfect correct prediction, -1.0 is perfect incorrect prediction, and 0.0 is random.},

	Abstract = {Estimating the maximum recommended starting dose (MRSD) of a pharmaceutical for phase I human clinical trials and the no observed effect level (NOEL) for non-pharmaceuticals is currently based exclusively on an extrapolation of the results of animal toxicity studies. This process is inexact and requires the results of toxicity studies in multiple species (rat, dog, and monkey) to identify the no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) and most sensitive test species. Multiple uncertainty (safety) factors are also necessary to compensate for incompatibility and uncertainty underlying the extrapolation of animal toxicity to humans. The maximum recommended daily dose for pharmaceuticals (MRDD) is empirically derived from human clinical trials. The MRDD is an estimated upper dose limit beyond which a drug's efficacy is not increased and/or undesirable adverse effects begin to outweigh beneficial effects. The MRDD is essentially equivalent to the NOAEL in humans, a dose beyond which adverse (toxicological) or undesirable pharmacological effects are observed. The NOAEL in test animals is currently used to estimate the safe starting dose in human clinical trials. MDL QSAR predictive modeling of the human MRDD may provide a better, simpler and more relevant estimation of the MRSD for pharmaceuticals and the toxic dose threshold of chemicals in humans than current animal extrapolation based risk assessment models and may be a useful addition to current methods. A database of the MRDD for over 1300 pharmaceuticals was compiled and modeled using MDL QSAR software and E-state and connectivity topological descriptors. MDL QSAR MRDD models were found to have good predictive performance with 74-78\% of predicted MRDD values for 120 internal and 160 external validation compounds falling within a range of +/-10-fold the actual MRDD value. The predicted MRDD can be used to estimate the MRSD for pharmaceuticals in phase I clinical trials with the addition of a 10-fold safety factor. For non-pharmaceutical chemicals any compound-related effect can be considered an undesirable and adverse toxicological effect and the predicted MRDD can be used to estimate the NOEL with the addition of an appropriate safety factor.

	Abstract = {Abstract: A general feeling of disillusionment with QSAR has settled across the modeling community in recent years. Most practitioners seem to agree that QSAR has not fulfilled the expectations set for its ability to predict biological activity. Among the possible reasons that have been proposed recently for this disappointment are chance correlation, rough response surfaces, incorrect functional forms, and overtraining. Undoubtedly, each of these plays an important role in the lack of predictivity seen in most QSAR models. Likely to be just as important is the role of the fallacy cum hoc ergo propter hoc in the poor prediction seen with many QSAR models. By embracing fallacy along with an over reliance on statistical inference, it may well be that the manner in which QSAR is practiced is more responsible for its lack of success than any other innate cause.},

	Abstract = {Abstract: We present the application of a Java remote method invocation (RMI) based open source architecture to distributed chemical computing. This architecture was previously employed for distributed data harvesting of chemical information from the Internet via the Google application programming interface (API; ChemXtreme). Due to its open source character and its flexibility, the underlying server/client framework can be quickly adopted to virtually every computational task that can be parallelized. Here, we present the server/client communication framework as well as an application to distributed computing of chemical properties on a large scale (currently the size of PubChem; about 18 million compounds), using both the Marvin toolkit as well as the open source JOELib package. As an application, for this set of compounds, the agreement of log P and TPSA between the packages was compared. Outliers were found to be mostly non-druglike compounds and differences could usually be explained by differences in the underlying algorithms. ChemStar is the first open source distributed chemical computing environment built on Java RMI, which is also easily adaptable to user demands due to its plug-in architecture. The complete source codes as well as calculated properties along with links to PubChem resources are available on the Internet via a graphical user interface at http://moltable.ncl.res.in/chemstar/.},

	Abstract = {Abstract: We report methods to predict the intrinsic aqueous solubility of crystalline organic molecules from two different thermodynamic cycles. We find that direct computation of solubility, via ab initio calculation of thermodynamic quantities at an affordable level of theory, cannot deliver the required accuracy. Therefore, we have turned to a mixture of direct computation and informatics, using the calculated thermodynamic properties, along with a few other key descriptors, in regression models. The prediction of log intrinsic solubility (referred to mol/L) by a three-variable linear regression equation gave r2 = 0.77 and RMSE = 0.71 for an external test set comprising drug molecules. The model includes a calculated crystal lattice energy which provides a computational method to account for the interactions in the solid state. We suggest that it is not necessary to know the polymorphic form prior to prediction. Furthermore, the method developed here may be applicable to other solid-state systems such as salts or cocrystals. Keywords: ADME; QSPR; crystal; lattice energy; solvation; pharmacokinetics.},

	Abstract = {Abstract: In this work we explore the possibilities of using fragment-based screening data to prioritize compounds from a full HTS library, a method we call virtual fragment linking (VFL). The ability of VFL to identify compounds of nanomolar potency based on micromolar fragment binding data was tested on 75 target classes from the WOMBAT database and succeeded in 57 cases. Further, the method was demonstrated for seven drug targets from in-house screening programs that performed both FBS of 8800 fragments and screens of the full library. VFL captured between 28% and 67% of the hits (IC50 < 10microM) in the top 5% of the ranked library for four of the targets (enrichment between 5-fold and 13-fold). Our findings lead us to conclude that proper coverage of chemical space by the fragment library is crucial for the VFL methodology to be successful in prioritizing HTS libraries from fragment-based screening data.},

We have developed a large database of ligand binding sites extracted automatically from the Protein Data Bank. This has been combined with a method for calculating binding site similarity based on geometric hashing to create a relational database for the retrieval of site similarity and binding site superposition. It contains an all-against-all comparison of binding sites and holds known protein-ligand binding sites. which are made accessible to data mining. Here we demonstrate its utility in two structure-based applications: in determining site similarity and in aiding the derivation of a receptor-based pharmacophore model.

	Abstract = {The study of protein target families, as opposed to single targets, has become a very powerful tool in chemogenomics-led drug discovery. By integrating comprehensive chemoinformatics and bioinformatics databases with customised analytical tools, a 'Toolkit' approach for the target family is possible, thus allowing predictions of the ligand class, affinity, selectivity and likely off-target issues to be made for the guidance of the medicinal chemist. In this review, we highlight the development and application of the Toolkit approach to the protein kinase superfamily, drawing on examples from lead optimisation studies and the design of focused libraries for lead discovery.},

	Abstract = {Abstract: Three field-based similarity methods are compared in retrospective virtual screening experiments. The methods are the CatShape module of CATALYST, ROCS, and an in-house program developed at the University of Sheffield called FBSS. The programs are used in both rigid and flexible searches carried out in the MDL Drug Data Report. UNITY 2D fingerprints are also used to provide a comparison with a more traditional approach to similarity searching, and similarity based on simple whole-molecule properties is used to provide a baseline for the more sophisticated searches. Overall, UNITY 2D fingerprints and ROCS with the chemical force field option gave comparable performance and were superior to the shape-only 3D methods. When the flexible methods were compared with the rigid methods, it was generally found that the flexible methods gave slightly better results than their respective rigid methods; however, the increased performance did not justify the additional computational cost required.},

	Abstract = {The similarity of drug targets is typically measured using sequence or structural information. Here, we consider chemo-centric approaches that measure target similarity on the basis of their ligands, asking how chemoinformatics similarities differ from those derived bioinformatically, how stable the ligand networks are to changes in chemoinformatics metrics, and which network is the most reliable for prediction of pharmacology. We calculated the similarities between hundreds of drug targets and their ligands and mapped the relationship between them in a formal network. Bioinformatics networks were based on the BLAST similarity between sequences, while chemoinformatics networks were based on the ligand-set similarities calculated with either the Similarity Ensemble Approach (SEA) or a method derived from Bayesian statistics. By multiple criteria, bioinformatics and chemoinformatics networks differed substantially, and only occasionally did a high sequence similarity correspond to a high ligand-set similarity. In contrast, the chemoinformatics networks were stable to the method used to calculate the ligand-set similarities and to the chemical representation of the ligands. Also, the chemoinformatics networks were more natural and more organized, by network theory, than their bioinformatics counterparts: ligand-based networks were found to be small-world and broad-scale.},

	Abstract = {Epigenetic effects in mammals depend largely on heritable genomic methylation patterns. We describe a computational pattern recognition method that is used to predict the methylation landscape of human brain DNA. This method can be applied both to CpG islands and to non-CpG island regions. It computes the methylation propensity for an 800-bp region centered on a CpG dinucleotide based on specific sequence features within the region. We tested several classifiers for classification performance, including K means clustering, linear discriminant analysis, logistic regression, and support vector machine. The best performing classifier used the support vector machine approach. Our program (called HDFINDER) presently has a prediction accuracy of 86\%, as validated with CpG regions for which methylation status has been experimentally determined. Using HDFINDER, we have depicted the entire genomic methylation patterns for all 22 human autosomes.},

@article{Fang:2006aa,
	Abstract = {Motivation: Over 50\% of human genes contain CpG islands in their 5'-regions. Methylation patterns of CpG islands are involved in tissue-specific gene expression and regulation. Mis-epigenetic silencing associated with aberrant CpG island methylation is one mechanism leading to the loss of tumor suppressor functions in cancer cells. Large-scale experimental detection of DNA methylation is still both labor-intensive and time-consuming. Therefore, it is necessary to develop in silico approaches for predicting methylation status of CpG islands.

Results: Based on a recent genome-scale dataset of DNA methylation in human brain tissues, we developed a classifier called MethCGI for predicting methylation status of CpG islands using a support vector machine (SVM). Nucleotide sequence contents as well as transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs) are used as features for the classification. The method achieves specificity of 84.65\% and sensitivity of 84.32\% on the brain data, and can also correctly predict about two-third of the data from other tissues reported in the MethDB database.},

@article{Bock:2008aa,
	Abstract = {Epigenetic research aims to understand heritable gene regulation that is not directly encoded in the DNA sequence. Epigenetic mechanisms such as DNA methylation and histone modifications modulate the packaging of the DNA in the nucleus and thereby influence gene expression. Patterns of epigenetic information are faithfully propagated over multiple cell divisions, which makes epigenetic regulation a key mechanism for cellular differentiation and cell fate decisions. In addition, incomplete erasure of epigenetic information can lead to complex patterns of non-Mendelian inheritance. Stochastic and environment-induced epigenetic defects are known to play a major role in cancer and ageing, and they may also contribute to mental disorders and autoimmune diseases. Recent technical advances such as ChIP-on-chip and ChIP-seq have started to convert epigenetic research into a high-throughput endeavor, to which bioinformatics is expected to make significant contributions. Here, we review pioneering computational studies that have contributed to epigenetic research. In addition, we give a brief introduction into epigeneticstargeted at bioinformaticians who are new to the fieldand we outline future challenges in computational epigenetics.

	Abstract = {MDM2 binds the p53 tumor suppressor protein with high affinity and negatively modulates its transcriptional activity and stability. Overexpression of MDM2, found in many human tumors, effectively impairs p53 function. Inhibition of MDM2-p53 interaction can stabilize p53 and may offer a novel strategy for cancer therapy. Here, we identify potent and selective small-molecule antagonists of MDM2 and confirm their mode of action through the crystal structures of complexes. These compounds bind MDM2 in the p53-binding pocket and activate the p53 pathway in cancer cells, leading to cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, and growth inhibition of human tumor xenografts in nude mice. },

	Abstract = {Structure-based drug design seeks to exploit the structure of protein-ligand or protein-protein binding sites, but the site is not always known at the outset. Even when the site is known, the researcher may wish to identify alternative prospective binding sites that may result in different biological effects or new class of compounds. It is also vital in lead optimization to clearly understand the degree to which known binders or docking hits satisfy or violate complementarity to the receptor. SiteMap is a new technique for identifying potential binding sites and for predicting their druggability in lead-discovery applications and for characterizing binding sites and critically assessing prospective ligands in lead-optimization applications. In large-scale validation tests, SiteMap correctly identifies the known binding site in > 96\% of the cases, with best results (> 98\%) coming for sites that bind ligands tightly. It also accurately distinguishes between sites that bind ligands and sites that don't. In binding-site analysis, SiteMap provides a wealth of quantitative and graphical information that can help guide efforts to modify ligand structure to enhance potency or improve physical properties. These attributes allow SiteMap to nicely complement techniques such as docking and computational lead optimization in structure-base drug design.},

	Abstract = {We present an extension and confirmation of our previously published method (J.~Med.~Chem. 2002, 45, 2867-2876) for the prediction of volume of distribution (VD) in humans for neutral and basic compounds. It is based on two experimentally determined physicochemical parameters, ElogD(7.4) and f(i(7.4)), the latter being the fraction of compound ionized at pH 7.4, and on the fraction of free drug in plasma (f(u)). By regressing the fraction unbound in tissues, f(ut), vs the above parameters, we demonstrate the ruggedness of the method in predicting VD through the Oie-Tozer equation, via the use of several testing approaches. A comparison is also presented between several methods based on animal pharmacokinetic data, using the same set of proprietary compounds, and it lends further support for the use of this method, as opposed to methods that require the gathering of pharmacokinetic data in laboratory animals. The reduction in the use of animals and the overall faster and cheaper accessibility of the parameters used make this method highly attractive for prospectively predicting the VD of new chemical entities in humans.},

The fraction unbound in tissues (f(ut)), determined via a regression analysis from 64 compounds using the parameters, described, is then used to predict VDss via the Ole-Tozer equation. Accuracy of this method was determined using a test set of 14 compounds, and it was demonstrated that human VDss values could be predicted, on average, within or very close to 2-fold of the actual value. The present method is as accurate as reported methods based on animal pharmacokinetic data, using a similar set of compounds, and ranges between 1.62 and 2.20 as mean-fold error. This method has the advantage of being amenable to automation, and therefore fast throughput, it is compound and resources sparing, and it offers a rationale for the reduction of the use of animals in pharmacokinetic studies. A discussion of the potential errors that may be encountered, including errors in the determination of f(u), is offered, and the caveats about the use of computed vs experimentally determined logD and pK(a) values are addressed.},

Extrapolating these models to Pfizer chemical space is difficult due to P-glycoprotein (P-gp) mediated efflux. Low correlation coefficients for this test set are improved (R-2 stop=0.39) when compounds known to be P-gp substrates or statistical extrapolations are removed.

	Abstract = {Abstract: High-throughput screening (HTS) is widely used in drug discovery. Especially for screens of unbiased libraries, false positives can dominate hit lists; their origins are much debated. Here we determine the mechanism of every active hit from a screen of 70,563 unbiased molecules against -lactamase using quantitative HTS (qHTS). Of the 1274 initial inhibitors, 95% were detergent-sensitive and were classified as aggregators. Among the 70 remaining were 25 potent, covalent-acting -lactams. Mass spectra, counter-screens, and crystallography identified 12 as promiscuous covalent inhibitors. The remaining 33 were either aggregators or irreproducible. No specific reversible inhibitors were found. We turned to molecular docking to prioritize molecules from the same library for testing at higher concentrations. Of 16 tested, 2 were modest inhibitors. Subsequent X-ray structures corresponded to the docking prediction. Analog synthesis improved affinity to 8 microM. These results suggest that it may be the physical behavior of organic molecules, not their reactivity, that accounts for most screening artifacts. Structure-based methods may prioritize weak-but-novel chemotypes in unbiased library screens.},

@article{Jiang:2008aa,
	Abstract = {The creation of enzymes capable of catalyzing any desired chemical reaction is a grand challenge for computational protein design. Using new algorithms that rely on hashing techniques to construct active sites for multistep reactions, we designed retro-aldolases that use four different catalytic motifs to catalyze the breaking of a carbon-carbon bond in a nonnatural substrate. Of the 72 designs that were experimentally characterized, 32, spanning a range of protein folds, had detectable retro-aldolase activity. Designs that used an explicit water molecule to mediate proton shuffling were significantly more successful, with rate accelerations of up to four orders of magnitude and multiple turnovers, than those involving charged side-chain networks. The atomic accuracy of the design process was confirmed by the x-ray crystal structure of active designs embedded in two protein scaffolds, both of which were nearly superimposable on the design model.

@article{Bo:2004aa,
	Abstract = {Microarray experiments generate data sets with information on the expression levels of thousands of genes in a set of biological samples. Unfortunately, such experiments often produce multiple missing expression values, normally due to various experimental problems. As many algorithms for gene expression analysis require a complete data matrix as input, the missing values have to be estimated in order to analyze the available data. Alternatively, genes and arrays can be removed until no missing values remain. However, for genes or arrays with only a small number of missing values, it is desirable to impute those values. For the subsequent analysis to be as informative as possible, it is essential that the estimates for the missing gene expression values are accurate. A small amount of badly estimated missing values in the data might be enough for clustering methods, such as hierachical clustering or K-means clustering, to produce misleading results. Thus, accurate methods for missing value estimation are needed. We present novel methods for estimation of missing values in microarray data sets that are based on the least squares principle, and that utilize correlations between both genes and arrays. For this set of methods, we use the common reference name LSimpute. We compare the estimation accuracy of our methods with the widely used KNNimpute on three complete data matrices from public data sets by randomly knocking out data (labeling as missing). From these tests, we conclude that our LSimpute methods produce estimates that consistently are more accurate than those obtained using KNNimpute. Additionally, we examine a more classic approach to missing value estimation based on expectation maximization (EM). We refer to our EM implementations as EMimpute, and the estimate errors using the EMimpute methods are compared with those our novel methods produce. The results indicate that on average, the estimates from our best performing LSimpute method are at least as accurate as those from the best EMimpute algorithm.},

@article{Bemis:1996aa,
	Abstract = {In order to better understand the common features present in drug molecules, we use shape description methods to analyze a database of commercially available drugs and prepare a list of common drug shapes. A useful way of organizing this structural data is to group the atoms of each drug molecule into ring, linker, framework, and side chain atoms. On the basis of the two-dimensional molecular structures (without regard to atom type, hybridization; and bond order), there are 1179 different frameworks among the 5120 compounds analyzed. However, the shapes of half of the drugs in the database are described by the 32 most frequently occurring frameworks. This suggests that the diversity of shapes in the set of known drugs is extremely low. In our second method of analysis, in which atom type, hybridization, and bond order are considered, more diversity is seen; there are 2506 different frameworks among the 5120 compounds in the database, and the most frequently occurring 42 frameworks account for only one-fourth of the drugs. We discuss the possible interpretations of these findings and the way they may be used to guide future drug discovery research.},

	Abstract = {Background: Modeling of metabolic networks includes tasks such as network assembly, network overview, calculation of metabolic fluxes and testing the robustness of the network.

Results: YANAsquare provides a software framework for rapid network assembly (flexible pathway browser with local or remote operation mode), network overview (visualization routine and YANAsquare editor) and network performance analysis (calculation of flux modes as well as target and robustness tests). YANAsquare comes as an easy-to-setup program package in Java. It is fully compatible and integrates the programs YANA (translation of gene expression values into flux distributions, metabolite network dissection) and Metatool (elementary mode calculation). As application examples we set-up and model the phospholipid network in the phagosome and genome-scale metabolic maps of S. aureus, S. epidermidis and S. saprophyticus as well as test their robustness against enzyme impairment.

Conclusion: YANAsquare is an application software for rapid setup, visualization and analysis of small, larger and genome-scale metabolic networks.},

	Abstract = {Motivation: Biological pathways provide significant insights on the interaction mechanisms of molecules. Presently, many essential pathways still remain unknown or incomplete for newly sequenced organisms. Moreover, experimental validation of enormous numbers of possible pathway candidates in a wet-lab environment is time-and effort-extensive. Thus, there is a need for comparative genomics tools that help scientists predict pathways in an organism's biological network. Results: In this article, we propose a technique to discover unknown pathways in organisms. Our approach makes in- depth use of Gene Ontology (GO)-based functionalities of enzymes involved in metabolic pathways as follows: (i) Model each pathway as a biological functionality graph of enzyme GO functions, which we call pathway functionality template. (ii) Locate frequent pathway functionality patterns so as to infer previously unknown pathways through pattern matching in metabolic networks of organisms. We have experimentally evaluated the accuracy of the presented technique for 30 bacterial organisms to predict around 1500 organism-specific versions of 50 reference pathways. Using cross-validation strategy on known pathways, we have been able to infer pathways with 86\% precision and 72\% recall for enzymes (i.e. nodes). The accuracy of the predicted enzyme relationships has been measured at 85\% precision with 64\% recall.},

	Abstract = {The hypothesis that acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibition is the mechanism of toxicity of organophosphorus (OP) compounds was examined by mathematically modeling the in vivo lethal effects of OP compounds and determining the amount of variation in OP toxicity that is explained by AChE inhibition. Mortality dose-response curves for several OP compounds (i.e., VX, soman, cyclosarin, sarin, tabun, diisopropylfluorophosphate and paraoxon) exhibited steep probit slopes (> 9.6) in guinea pigs. Steep probit slopes were also observed when the mortality dose-response curves for soman were examined in mice, rats, rabbits and non-human primates. The consistently steep probit slopes of the dose-response curves for highly toxic OP compounds suggested that these compounds have a single specific mechanism of toxicity regardless of the OP compound or the species in which it was tested. Regression analysis indicated that 93\% of the 3,280-fold variation in the median lethal doses (i.e., LD50) of OP compounds in rats was explained by the variation in their in vitro rate constants for inhibition of AChE. Conversely, 91\% of the 23-fold variation in the ability of the oximes pralidoxime and obidoxime to protect against the toxicity of OP compounds in guinea pigs was explained by the variation in the in vitro ability of oximes to reactivate OP-inhibited AChE. The best explanation for this variety of observations was that the primary mechanism of in vivo toxicity for highly toxic OP compounds is the inhibition of AChE, and the residual unexplained variation in OP toxicity that might be explained by other mechanisms represents < 10\% of the total variation in OP toxicity.},

	Abstract = {In drug design, it is crucial to have reliable information on how a chemical entity behaves in the presence of metabolizing enzymes. This requires substantial experimental efforts. Consequently, being able to predict the likely site/s of metabolism in any compound, synthesized or virtual, would be highly beneficial and time efficient.

In this work, six different methodologies for predictions of the site of metabolism (SOM) have been compared and validated using structurally diverse data sets of drug-like molecules with well-established metabolic pattern in CYP3A4, CYP2C9, or both. Three of the methods predict the SOM based on the ligand's chemical structure, two additional methods use structural information of the enzymes, and the sixth method combines structure and ligand similarity and reactivity. The SOM is correctly predicted in 50 to 90\% of the cases, depending on method and enzyme, which is an encouraging rate. We also discuss the underlying mechanisms of cytochrome P450 metabolism in the light of the results from this comparison.},

It is defined as the difference between nucleophilic (omega(+)(k)) and electrophilic (omega(-)(k)) condensed philicity functions. This descriptor is capable of simultaneously explaining the nucleophilicity and electrophilicity of the given atomic sites in the molecule. Variation of these quantities along the path of a soft reaction is also analyzed. Predictive ability of this descriptor has been successfully tested on the selected systems and reactions. Corresponding force profiles are also analyzed in some representative cases. Also, to study the intra- and intermolecular reactivities another related descriptor, namely, the nucleophilicity excess (Delta omega(f)(g)) for a nucleophile over the electrophilicity in it, has been defined and tested on all-metal aromatic compounds.},

The regioselectivity shown by the local hardness values is in agreement with the empirical Markovnikov's rule. The effects of the electron-donating and electron-withdrawing substituents in the addition reactions have been studied in detail by calculating the energy of addition reaction and the activation energy for the transition states. It has been found that the strong electron-withdrawing substituents prefer to lead anti-Markovnikov products, while the electron-donating and weak electron-withdrawing groups prefer to form Markovnikov products.

The overlap between metabolites and non-metabolites was observed to be the least in the space defined by the global descriptors, the most discriminatory features being the number of OH groups, presence of aromatic systems, and molecular weight. Discrimination between the two datasets was achieved with accuracy up to 97\%. Models were built to produce a metabolite-likeness parameter.

	Abstract = {The combination of high-throughput methods of molecular biology with advanced mathematical and computational techniques has propelled the emergent field of systems biology into a position of prominence. Unthinkable a decade ago, it has become possible to screen and analyze the expression of entire genomes, simultaneously assess large numbers of proteins and their prevalence, and characterize in detail the metabolic state of a cell population. Although very important, the focus on comprehensive networks of biological components is only one side of systems biology. Complementing large-scale assessments, and sometimes at the risk of being forgotten, are more subtle analyses that rationalize the design and functioning of biological modules in exquisite detail. This intricate side of systems biology aims at identifying the specific roles of processes and signals in smaller, fully regulated systems by computing what would happen if these signals were lacking or organized in a different fashion. We exemplify this type of approach with a detailed analysis of the regulation of glucose utilization in Lactococcus lactis. This organism is exposed to alternating periods of glucose availability and starvation. During starvation, it accumulates an intermediate of glycolysis, which allows it to take up glucose immediately upon availability. This notable accumulation poses a nontrivial control task that is solved with an unusual, yet ingeniously designed and timed feedforward activation system. The elucidation of this control system required high-precision, dynamic in vivo metabolite data, combined with methods of nonlinear systems analysis, and may serve as a paradigm for multidisciplinary approaches to fine-scaled systems biology.},

	Abstract = {The antibiotic kijanimicin produced by the actinomycete Actinomadura kijaniata has a broad spectrum of bioactivities as well as a number of interesting biosynthetic features. To understand the molecular basis for its formation and to develop a combinatorial biosynthetic system for this class of compounds, a 107.6 kb segment of the A. kijaniata chromosome containing the kijanimicin biosynthetic locus was identified, cloned, and sequenced. The complete pathway for the formation of TDP-L-digitoxose, one of the two sugar donors used in construction of kijanimicin, was elucidated through biochemical analysis of four enzymes encoded in the gene cluster. Sequence analysis indicates that the aglycone kijanolide is formed by the combined action of a modular Typed polyketide synthase, a conserved set of enzymes involved in formation, attachment, and intramolecular cyclization of a glycerate-derived three-carbon unit, which forms the core of the spirotetronate moiety. The genes involved in the biosynthesis of the unusual deoxysugar D-kijanose [2,3,4,6-tetradeoxy-4-(methyl carbamyl)-3-C-methyl-3-nitro-D-xylo-hexopyranose], including one encoding a flavoenzyme predicted to catalyze the formation of the nitro group, have also been identified. This work has implications for the biosynthesis of other spirotetronate antibiotics and nitrosugar-bearing natural products, as well as for future mechanistic and biosynthetic engineering efforts.},

	Abstract = {Background: The nuclear receptors are a large family of eukaryotic transcription factors that constitute major pharmacological targets. They exert their combinatorial control through homotypic heterodimerisation. Elucidation of this dimerisation network is vital in order to understand the complex dynamics and potential cross-talk involved.

Results: Phylogeny, protein-protein interactions, protein-DNA interactions and gene expression data have been integrated to provide a comprehensive and up-to-date description of the topology and properties of the nuclear receptor interaction network in humans. We discriminate between DNA-binding and non-DNA-binding dimers, and provide a comprehensive interaction map, that identifies potential cross-talk between the various pathways of nuclear receptors.

Conclusion: We infer that the topology of this network is hub-based, and much more connected than previously thought. The hub-based topology of the network and the wide tissue expression pattern of NRs create a highly competitive environment for the common heterodimerising partners. Furthermore, a significant number of negative feedback loops is present, with the hub protein SHP [ NR0B2] playing a major role. We also compare the evolution, topology and properties of the nuclear receptor network with the hub-based dimerisation network of the bHLH transcription factors in order to identify both unique themes and ubiquitous properties in gene regulation. In terms of methodology, we conclude that such a comprehensive picture can only be assembled by semi-automated text-mining, manual curation and integration of data from various sources.},

	Abstract = {An analysis of molecular dynamics simulation of a model -helix indicates that the motion of the helix system is chaotic. This system's behavior is due to an intrinsic sensitivity to initial conditions, which makes initially similar conformations of the helix evolve into completely different conformations. The chaotic properties of the system can be clearly identified in terms of nonzero Lyapunov exponents, broad-band power spectra, and strange attractors. The dominant factors resulting in the chaos are found to be (1) the nonlinear interactions inherent in the system's force field, (2) the restraints (such as the restraints on temperature, dihedral angles, and bond lengths), and (3) the stochastic forces generated by the solvent. These results suggest a limitation for the predictive capabilities of the molecular dynamics simulation method in studies of biomolecules and, especially, have important implications to the studies of the protein-folding problem.},

	Abstract = {Abstract: Studies to assess the risks of revealing chemical structures by sharing various chemical descriptor data are presented. Descriptors examined include "Lipinski-like" properties, 2D-BCUT descriptors, and a high-dimensional "fingerprint-like" descriptor (MACCs-vector). We demonstrate that unless sufficient precautions are taken, de novo design software such as EA-Inventor is able to derive a unique chemical structure or a set of closely related analogs from some commonly used descriptors. Based on the results of our studies, a set of guidelines or recommendations for safely sharing chemical information without revealing chemical structure is presented. A procedure for assessing the risk of revealing chemical structure when exchanging chemical descriptor information was also developed. The procedure is generic and can be applied to any chemical descriptor or combination of descriptors and to any set of structures to enable a decision about whether the exchange of information can be done without revealing the chemical structures.},

@article{Pandey:2005aa,
	Abstract = {Falcipain-2 (FP2) is a papain family cysteine protease and important hemoglobinase of erythrocytic Plasmodium falciparum parasites. Inhibitors of FP2 block hemoglobin hydrolysis and parasite development, suggesting that this enzyme is a promising target for antimalarial chemotherapy. FP2 and related plasmodial cysteine proteases have an unusual 14-aa motif near the C terminus of the catalytic domain. Recent solution of the structure of FP2 showed this motif to form a beta-hairpin that is distant from the enzyme active site and protrudes out from the protein. To evaluate the function of this motif, we compared the activity of the wild-type enzyme with that of a mutant lacking 10 aa of the motif ((Delta 10)FP2). (Delta 10)FP2 had nearly identical activity to that of the wild-type enzyme against peptide substrates and the protein substrates casein and gelatin. However, (Delta 10)FP2 demonstrated negligible activity against hemoglobin or globin. FP2 that was inhibited with trans-epoxysuccinyl-L-leucylamido-(4-guanidino)butane (FP2E-64) formed a complex with hemoglobin, but (Delta 10)FP2(E-64) did not, indicating that the motif mediates binding to hemoglobin independent of the active site. A peptide encoding the motif blocked hemoglobin hydrolysis, but not the hydrolysis of casein. Kinetics for the inhibition of (Delta 10)FP2 were very similar to those for FP2 with peptidyl and protein inhibitors, but (Delta 10)FP2 was poorly inhibited by the inhibitory prodomain of FP2. Our results indicate that FP2 utilizes an unusual motif for two specific functions, interaction with hemoglobin, its natural substrate, and interaction with the prodomain, its natural inhibitor.},

	Abstract = {A targeted series of phenolic Mannich bases of benzaldehyde and (thio)semicarbazone derivatives were synthesized and evaluated in vitro against the malarial cysteine protease falcipain-2 and a chloroquine resistant strain (W2) of Plasinodium falciparum. A novel series of 4-aminoquinoline semicarbazones were the most effective inhibitors of falcipain-2 (most potent inhibitor had IC50 = 0.63 mu M) while a bisquitioline semicarbazone compound 8f was the most potent antimalarial compound with an IC50 Of 0.07 mu M against W2. Compound 8f also weakly inhibited falcipain-2, with an IC50 of 3.16 mu M, although its principal antiparasitic activity did not appear to be due to inhibition of this enzyme. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

	Abstract = {The recent REACH Policy of the European Union has led to scientists and regulators to focus their attention on establishing general validation principles for QSAR models in the context of chemical regulation (previously known as the Setubal, nowadays, the OECD principles). This paper gives a brief analysis of some principles: unambiguous algorithm, Applicability Domain (AD), and statistical validation. Some concerns related to QSAR algorithm reproducibility and an example of a fast check of the applicability domain for MLR models are presented. Common myths and misconceptions related to popular techniques for verifying internal predictivity, particularly for MLR models (for instance cross-validation, bootstrap), are commented on and compared with commonly used statistical techniques for external validation. The differences in the two validating approaches are highlighted, and evidence is presented that only models that have been validated externally, after their internal validation, can be considered reliable and applicable for both external prediction and regulatory purposes.},

	Abstract = { Unlike signalling pathways, metabolic networks are subject to strict stoichiometric constraints. Metabolomics amplifies changes in the proteome, and represents more closely the phenotype of an organism. Recent advances enable the production (and computer-readable encoding as SBML) of metabolic network models reconstructed from genome sequences, as well as experimental measurements of much of the metabolome. There is increasing convergence between the number of human metabolites estimated via genomics (~3000) and the number measured experimentally. It is thus both timely, and now possible, to bring these two approaches together as an integrated (if distributed) whole to help understand the genesis of metabolic biomarkers, the progress of disease, and the modes of action, efficacy, off-target effects and toxicity of pharmaceutical drugs.},

                  Labs in the mid-90's.  (J. Van Drie, M. Lajiness,
                  M. Johnson, T. Hagadone, and G. Maggiora), but was
                  not published; that joint work was publicly
                  disclosed initially by Van Drie in his talk at an
                  IBC conference in San Diego in 1997.  It was
                  implemented in the Upjohn cheminformatics system
                  Cousin, now Pfizer's Chemlink.  It was also
                  implemented in the VERDI cheminformatics system at
                  Vertex.  An apparently independent rediscovery of
                  this idea occurred to a group at Merck in the UK,
                  also unpublished, and was implemented in a software
                  system at that now-defunct site.  Many institutions
                  have implemented this idea as a protocol for the
                  commercial cheminformatics workflow tool, Pipeline

	Abstract = {Academic and industrial research continues to be focused on discovering new classes of compounds based on HTS. Post-HTS analyses need to prioritize compounds that are progressed to chemical probe or lead status. We report trends in probe, lead and drug discovery by examining the following categories of compounds: 385 leads and the 541 drugs that emerged from them; "active" (152) and "inactive" (1488) compounds from the Molecular Libraries Initiative Small Molecule Repository (MLSMR) tested by HTS; "active" (46) and "inactive" (72) compounds from Nature Chemical Biology (NCB) tested by HTS; compounds in the drug development phase (I, II, III and launched), as indexed in MDDR; and medicinal chemistry compounds from WOMBAT, separated into high-activity (5,784 compounds with nanomolar activity or better) and low-activity (30,690 with micromolar activity or less). We examined Molecular weight (MW), molecular complexity, flexibility, the number of hydrogen bond donors and acceptors, LogP-the octanol/water partition coefficient estimated by ClogP and ALOGPS), LogSw (intrinsic water solubility, estimated by ALOGPS) and the number of Rule of five (Ro5) criteria violations. Based on the 50\% and 90\% distribution moments of the above properties, there were no significant difference between leads of known drugs and "actives" from MLSMR or NCB (chemical probes). "Inactives" from NCB and MLSMR were also found to exhibit similar properties. From these combined sets, we conclude that "Actives" (569 compounds) are less complex, less flexible, and more soluble than drugs (1,651 drugs), and significantly smaller, less complex, less hydrophobic and more soluble than the 5,784 high-activity WOMBAT compounds. These trends indicate that chemical probes are similar to leads with respect to some properties, e.g., complexity, solubility, and hydrophobicity.},

	Abstract = {Complementarity of molecular surfaces is crucial for molecular recognition. A method for representation of molecular shape is presented. We decompose the molecular surface into commensurate patches with defined shape by fitting hyperbolical paraboloids onto a triangulated isosurface of the Gaussian model of a molecule. As a result of this decomposition we obtain a 3D graph representation of the molecular shape, which can be used for complete and partial shape matching and isosteric group searching. To point out the possibilities and limitations of shape-only models, we challenged our method by three scenarios in a virtual screening contest: rigid body alignment, consensus shape filtering, and target-specific screening. {\copyright} 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

	Abstract = {The design, implementation, and capabilities of an extensible visualization system, UCSF Chimera, are discussed. Chimera is segmented into a core that provides basic services and visualization, and extensions that provide most higher level functionality. This architecture ensures that the extension mechanism satisfies the demands of outside developers who wish to incorporate new features. Two unusual extensions are presented: Multiscale, which adds the ability to visualize large-scale molecular assemblies such as viral coats, and Collaboratory, which allows researchers to share a Chimera session interactively despite being at separate locales. Other extensions include Multalign Viewer, for showing multiple sequence alignments and associated structures; ViewDock, for screening docked ligand orientations; Movie, for replaying molecular dynamics trajectories; and Volume Viewer, for display and analysis of volumetric data. A discussion of the usage of Chimera in real-world situations is given, along with anticipated future directions. Chimera includes full user documentation, is free to academic and nonprofit users, and is available for Microsoft Windows, Linux, Apple Mac OS X, SGI IRIX, and HP Tru64 Unix from http://www.cgl.ucsf.edu/chimera/.

	Abstract = {  The development of predictive statistical models is a common task in
  the field of drug design. The process of developing such models
  involves two main steps: building the model and then deploying the
  model. Traditionally such models have been deployed using web page
  interfaces. This approach restricts the user to using the specified
  web page and using the model in other ways can be cumbersome. In
  this paper we present a flexible and generalizable approach to the
  deployment of predictive models, based on a web service
  infrastructure using R. The infrastructure described allows one to
  access the functionality of these models using a variety of approach
  ranging from web pages to workflow tools. We highlight the
  advantages of this infrastructure by developing and subsequently
  deploying random forest models for two datasets.

	Abstract = {Cytochrome P450 2C9 (CYP2C9) is one of the most important phase 1 metabolizing enzymes in humans for therapeutically relevant pharmaceuticals. Any new compound inhibiting this membrane-associated protein would notably affect the metabolism of physiologically important molecules and drugs, resulting in clinically significant drug-drug interactions. In search for computational tools to identify potential CYP2C9 inhibitors early in discovery, we present here the construction of filters based on 1100 structurally diverse molecules tested for CYP2C9 inhibition under identical conditions. Their chemical structures were encoded using various 2D descriptors including Three-Point Pharmacophoric (3PP) fingerprints, followed by generation of statistical models using Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Partial Least Squares (PLS). This consistently led to significant and predictive models for regression and classification of CYP2C9 inhibitors. Their predictive ability was underscored by successfully applying them to different test sets of 238 diverse and 344 GPCR-targeted compounds. Even more important for early drug discovery is the ability of these models to correctly discriminate CYP2C9 inhibitors from inactive molecules. These models collectively are able to identify true CYP2C9 inhibitors with relatively low rates of false positives. The 3PP-based filter also allows visualizing important substructures and functional groups, which are linked to protein-ligand interactions for CYP2C9, as illustrated for selected structure-activity series. The application of these models to the substrate S-warfarin, recently co-crystallized with CYP2C9, revealed that the important substructures are indeed involved in the interaction with the CYP2C9 binding site. For example, the model correctly indicated aromatic stacking interactions with Phe114 and Phe476 as well as a hydrogen bond with Phe100. Hence, these models consistently provide guidelines for reducing CYP2C9 inhibition in novel candidate molecules.},

	Abstract = {A data set of 379 drugs and drug analogs that are metabolized by human cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoforms 3A4, 2D6, and 2C9, respectively, was studied. A series of descriptor sets directly calculable from the constitution of these drugs was systematically investigated as to their power into classifying a compound into the CYP isoform that metabolizes it. In a four-step build-up process eventually 303 different descriptor components were investigated for 146 compounds of a training set by various model building methods, such as multinomal logistic regression, decision tree, or support vector machine (SVM). Automatic variable selection algorithms were used in order to decrease the number of descriptors. A comprehensive scheme of cross-validation (CV) experiments was applied to assess the robustness and reliability of the four models developed. In addition, the predictive power of the four models presented in this paper was inspected by predicting an external validation data set with 233 compounds. The best model has a leave-one-out (LOO) cross-validated predictivity of 89\% and gives 83\% correct predictions for the external validation data set. For our favored model we showed the strong influence on the predictivity of the way a data set is split into a training and test data set.},

	Abstract = {In this paper, we study the classifications of unbalanced data sets of drugs. As an example we chose a data set of 2D6 inhibitors of cytochrome P450. The human cytochrome P450 2D6 isoform plays a key role in the metabolism of many drugs in the preclinical drug discovery process. We have collected a data set from annotated public data and calculated physicochemical properties with chemoinformatics methods. On top of this data, we have built classifiers based on machine learning methods. Data sets with different class distributions lead to the effect that conventional machine learning methods are biased toward the larger class. To overcome this problem and to obtain sensitive but also accurate classifiers we combine machine learning and feature selection methods with techniques addressing the problem of unbalanced classification, such as oversampling and threshold moving. We have used our own implementation of a support vector machine algorithm as well as the maximum entropy method. Our feature selection is based on the unsupervised McCabe method. The classification results from our test set are compared structurally with compounds from the training set. We show that the applied algorithms enable the effective high throughput in silico classification of potential drug candidates.},

	Abstract = {Predictions of the metabolic sites for new chemical entities, synthesized or only virtual, are important in the early phase of drug discovery to guide chemistry efforts in the synthesis of new compounds with reduced metabolic liability. This information can now be obtained from in silico predictions, and therefore, a thorough and unbiased evaluation of the computational techniques available is needed. Several computational methods to predict the metabolic hot spots are emerging. In this study, metabolite identification using MetaSite and a docking methodology, GLUE, were compared. Moreover, the published CYP3A4 crystal structure and computed CYP3A4 homology models were compared for their usefulness in predicting metabolic sites. A total of 227 known CYP3A4 substrates reported to have one or more metabolites adding up to 325 metabolic pathways were analyzed. Distance-based fingerprints and four-point pharmacophore derived from GRID molecular interaction fields were used to characterize the substrate and protein in MetaSite and the docking methodology, respectively. The CYP3A4 crystal structure and homology model with the reactivity factor enabled achieved a similar prediction success (78\%) using the MetaSite method. The docking method had a relatively lower prediction success (similar to 57\% for the homology model), although it still may provide useful insights for interactions between ligand and protein, especially for uncommon reactions. The MetaSite methodology is automated, rapid, and has relatively accurate predictions compared with the docking methodology used in this study.},

The key issues in drug metabolism include identifying: the enzyme(s) involved, the site(s) of metabolism, the resulting metabolite(s), and the rate of metabolism. Methods for predicting human drug metabolism from in vitro and computational methodologies and determining relationships between the structure and metabolic activity of molecules are also critically important for understanding potential drug interactions and toxicity. There are numerous experimental and computational approaches that have been developed in order to predict human metabolism which have their own limitations. It is apparent that few of the computational tools for metabolism prediction alone provide the major integrated functions needed to assist in drug discovery. Similarly the different in vitro methods for human drug metabolism themselves have implicit limitations. The utilization of these methods for pharmaceutical and other applications as well as their integration is discussed as it is likely that hybrid methods will provide the most success.},

	Abstract = {Numerous experimental and computational approaches have been developed to predict human drug metabolism. Since databases of human drug metabolism information are widely available, these can be used to train computational algorithms and generate predictive approaches. In turn, they may be used to assist in the identification of possible metabolites from a large number of molecules in drug discovery based on molecular structure alone. In the current study we have used a commercially available database (MetaDrug) and extracted a fraction of the human drug metabolism data. These data were used along with augmented atom descriptors in a predictive machine learning model, kernel-partial least squares (K-PLS). A total of 317 molecules, including parent drugs and their primary and secondary (sequential) metabolites, were used to build these models corresponding to individual metabolism rules, representing the formation of discrete metabolites, e. g., N-dealkylation. Each model was internally validated to assess the capability to classify other molecules that were left out. Using receiver operator curve statistics models for N-dealkylation, O-dealkylation, aromatic hydroxylation, aliphatic hydroxylation, O-glucuronidation, and O-sulfation gave area under the curve values from 0.75 to 0.84 and were able to predict between 61 and 79\% active molecules upon leave-one-out testing. This preliminary study indicates that K-PLS and possibly other similar machine learning methods (such as support vector machines) can be applied to predicting human drug metabolite formation in a classification manner. Improvements can be achieved using considerably larger datasets-that contain more positive examples for the less frequently occurring metabolite rules, as well as the external evaluation of novel molecules.},

@article{Kind:2007aa,
	Abstract = {Background: Structure elucidation of unknown small molecules by mass spectrometry is a challenge despite advances in instrumentation. The first crucial step is to obtain correct elemental compositions. In order to automatically constrain the thousands of possible candidate structures, rules need to be developed to select the most likely and chemically correct molecular formulas.

Results: An algorithm for filtering molecular formulas is derived from seven heuristic rules: (1) restrictions for the number of elements, (2) LEWIS and SENIOR chemical rules, (3) isotopic patterns, (4) hydrogen/carbon ratios, (5) element ratio of nitrogen, oxygen, phosphor, and sulphur versus carbon, (6) element ratio probabilities and (7) presence of trimethylsilylated compounds. Formulas are ranked according to their isotopic patterns and subsequently constrained by presence in public chemical databases. The seven rules were developed on 68,237 existing molecular formulas and were validated in four experiments. First, 432,968 formulas covering five million PubChem database entries were checked for consistency. Only 0.6\% of these compounds did not pass all rules. Next, the rules were shown to effectively reducing the complement all eight billion theoretically possible C, H, N, S, O, P-formulas up to 2000 Da to only 623 million most probable elemental compositions. Thirdly 6,000 pharmaceutical, toxic and natural compounds were selected from DrugBank, TSCA and DNP databases. The correct formulas were retrieved as top hit at 80-99\% probability when assuming data acquisition with complete resolution of unique compounds and 5\% absolute isotope ratio deviation and 3 ppm mass accuracy. Last, some exemplary compounds were analyzed by Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry and by gas chromatography-time of flight mass spectrometry. In each case, the correct formula was ranked as top hit when combining the seven rules with database queries.

Conclusion: The seven rules enable an automatic exclusion of molecular formulas which are either wrong or which contain unlikely high or low number of elements. The correct molecular formula is assigned with a probability of 98\% if the formula exists in a compound database. For truly novel compounds that are not present in databases, the correct formula is found in the first three hits with a probability of 65-81\%.

	Abstract = {Predictive metabolism methods can be used in drug discovery projects to enhance the understanding of structure-metabolism relationships. The present study uses data mining methods to exploit biotransformation data that have been recorded in the MDL Metabolite database. Reacting center fingerprints were derived from a comparison of substrates and their corresponding products listed in the database. This process yields two fingerprint databases: all atoms in all substrates and all reacting centers. The metabolic reaction data are then mined by submitting a new molecule and searching for fingerprint matches to every atom in the new molecule in both databases. An "occurrence ratio" is derived from the fingerprint matches between the submitted compound and the reacting center and substrate fingerprint databases. Normalization of the occurrence ratio within each submitted molecule enables the results of the search to be rank-ordered as a measure of the relative frequency of a reaction occurring at a specific site within the submitted molecule. Predictive performance that would allow this method to be used by drug discovery teams to generate useful hypotheses regarding structure metabolism relationships was observed.},

	Abstract = {Motivation: Proteome-wide prediction of protein-protein interaction is a difficult and important problem in biology. Although there have been recent advances in both experimental and computational methods for predicting protein-protein interactions, we are only beginning to see a confluence of these techniques. In this paper, we describe a very general, high-throughput method for predicting protein-protein interactions. Our method combines a sequence-based description of proteins with experimental information that can be gathered from any type of protein-protein interaction screen. The method uses a novel description of interacting proteins by extending the signature descriptor, which has demonstrated success in predicting peptide/protein binding interactions for individual proteins. This descriptor is extended to protein pairs by taking signature products. The signature product is implemented within a support vector machine classifier as a kernel function.

Results: We have applied our method to publicly available yeast, Helicobacter pylori, human and mouse datasets. We used the yeast and H.pylori datasets to verify the predictive ability of our method, achieving from 70 to 80\% accuracy rates using 10-fold cross-validation. We used the human and mouse datasets to demonstrate that our method is capable of cross-species prediction. Finally, we reused the yeast dataset to explore the ability of our algorithm to predict domains.},

The signature of an atom is a canonical representation of the atom's environment up to a predefined height h. The signature of a molecule is a vector of occurrence numbers of atomic signatures. Two QSAR and QSPR models based on signature are compared with models obtained using popular molecular 2D descriptors taken from a commercially available software (Molconn-Z). One set contains the inhibition concentration at 50\% for 121 HIV-1 protease inhibitors, while the second set contains 12865 octanol/water partitioning coefficients (Log P). For both data sets, the models created by signature performed comparable to those from the commercially available descriptors in both correlating the data and in predicting test set values not used in the parametrization. While probing signature's QSAR and QSPR performances, we demonstrates that for any given molecule of diameter D, there is a molecular signature of height h less than or equal to D+1, from which any 2D descriptor can be computed. As a consequence of this finding any QSAR or QSPR involving 2D descriptors can be replaced with a relationship involving occurrence number of atomic signatures.},

	Abstract = {The prediction of beta-sheet topology requires the consideration of long-range interactions between beta-strands that are not necessarily consecutive in sequence. Since these interactions are difficult to simulate using ab initio methods, we propose a supplementary method able to assign beta-sheet topology using only sequence information. We envision using the results of our method to reduce the three-dimensional search space of ab initio methods. Our method is based on the signature molecular descriptor, which has been used previously to predict protein-protein interactions successfully, and to develop quantitative structure-activity relationships for small organic drugs and peptide inhibitors. Here, we show how the signature descriptor can be used in a Support Vector Machine to predict whether or not two beta-strands will pack adjacently within a protein. We then show how these predictions can be used to order beta-strands within beta-sheets. Using the entire PDB database with ten-fold cross-validation, we have achieved 74.0\% accuracy in packing prediction and 75.6\% accuracy in the prediction of edge strands. For the case of beta-strand ordering, we are able to predict the correct ordering accurately for 51.3\% of the beta-sheets. Furthermore, using a simple confidence metric, we can determine those sheets for which accurate predictions can be obtained.

This collection is compared against the FDA drug database and a subset of the ZINC database by machine learning methods which rely on classical QSAR descriptors. We obtain a decision tree that contains three descriptors. Of particular importance is a constitutional descriptor related to molecular shape and size. Validation of the decision tree by various procedures indicates that it does not result from chance correlations and has predictive value. We conclude that constitutional descriptors may be valuable tools in the preselection of potential PPI inhibitors from compound databases.},

	Abstract = {Here we apply the computational solvent mapping (CS-Map) algorithm toward the in silico identification of hot spots, that is, regions of protein binding sites that are major contributors to the binding energy and, hence, are prime targets in drug design. The CS-Map algorithm, developed for binding site characterization, moves small organic functional groups around the protein surface and determines their most energetically favorable binding positions. The utility of CS-Map algorithm toward the prediction of hot spot regions in druggable binding pockets is illustrated by three test systems: (1) renin aspartic protease, (2) a set of previously characterized druggable proteins, and (3) E. coli ketopantoate reductase. In each of the three studies, existing literature was used to verify our results. Based on our analyses, we conclude that the information provided by CS-Map can contribute substantially to the identification of hot spots, a necessary predecessor of fragment-based drug discovery efforts.},

One striking feature is the relatively constant historical rate of target innovation ( the rate at which drugs against new targets are launched); however, the rate of developing drugs against new families is significantly lower. The recent approval of drugs that target protein kinases highlights two additional trends: an emerging realization of the importance of polypharmacology, and also the power of a gene-family-led approach in generating novel and important therapies.},

Valuable resources can be wasted on compound leads with significant 'side effects' on additional biological targets; therefore, technical refinements to identify compounds that primarily have effects resulting from a single target are needed. This study explores the use of multiple assays of a chemical library and a statistic based on entropy to identify lead compound classes that have patterns of assay activity resulting primarily from small molecule action on a single target. This statistic, called the coincidence score, discriminates with 88\% accuracy compound classes known to act primarily on a single target from compound classes with significant side effects on nonhomologous targets. Furthermore, a significant number of the compound classes predicted to have primarily single-target effects contain known bioactive compounds. We also show that a compound's known biological target or mechanism of action can often be suggested by its pattern of activities in multiple assays.},

	Abstract = {The concept of reaction similarity has been well studied in terms of the of overall transformation associated with a reaction, but not in terms of mechanism. We present the first method to give a quantitative measure of the similarity of reactions based upon their explicit mechanisms. Two approaches are presented to measure the similarity between individual steps of mechanisms: a fingerprint-based approach that incorporates relevant information on each mechanistic step; and an approach based only on bond formation, cleavage and changes in order. The overall similarity for two reaction mechanisms is then calculated using the Needleman-Wunsch alignment algorithm. An analysis of MACiE, a database of enzyme mechanisms, using our measure of similarity identifies some examples of convergent evolution of chemical mechanisms. In many cases, mechanism similarity is not reflected by similarity according to the EC system of enzyme classification. In particular, little mechanistic information is conveyed by the class level of the EC system. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

For each case we have compared the similarity-dissimilarity results for five proteomics maps of rat liver cells associated with the control group and four proliferators administrated by intraperitoneal injection.

	Abstract = {The high degree of virulence and potential for development of a pandemic strain of the H5N1 avian flu has resulted in wide interest in characterization of the various genes of the H5N1 virus genome. We have considered for our analysis all 173 available complete sequences, as of February 2006, of the neuraminidase gene, which is the target of the most effective treatment regimen comprising the inhibitors oseltamivir and zanamivir. We have used a 2D graphical representation of the neuraminidase RNA sequences of H5N1 strains to identify a few distinct structural motifs. The H5N1 strains were split into two main classes: strains that were benign to human beings in the years up to 1996 and the period 1999-2002 and strains that were highly pathogenic to humans in the periods 1997 and 2003 to present. Comparisons with earlier H1N1 pandemic and epidemic strains have also been made to understand the current status of the gene. Our findings indicate that the base composition and distribution patterns are significantly different in the two periods, and this may be of interest in studying mutational changes in such viral genes.},

	Abstract = {Over the last few years several authors have presented various methods to assign mathematical descriptors to DNA sequences in order to quantitatively compare the sequences and determine similarities and dissimilarities between them. The plethora of different methods used have made it necessary to compare them and determine which one(s), if any, best meet the needs required to characterize DNA sequences. With the very rapid rise in available DNA sequence data and the strong need for robust quantitative techniques to determine regions of interest in these sequences, numerical characterization of DNA and RNA sequences will be of great importance in filling a part of this need.},

	Abstract = {Abstract: Virtual screening of the Maybridge library of ca. 70 000 compounds was performed using a similarity filter, docking, and molecular mechanics-generalized Born/surface area postprocessing to seek potential non-nucleoside inhibitors of human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) reverse transcriptase (NNRTIs). Although known NNRTIs were retrieved well, purchase and assaying of representative, top-scoring compounds from the library failed to yield any active anti-HIV agents. However, the highest-ranked library compound, oxadiazole 1, was pursued as a potential "near-miss" with the BOMB program to seek constructive modifications. Subsequent synthesis and assaying of several polychloro-analogs did yield anti-HIV agents with EC50 values as low as 310 nM. The study demonstrates that it is possible to learn from a formally unsuccessful virtual-screening exercise and, with the aid of computational analyses, to efficiently evolve a false positive into a true active.},

@article{Baldi:2007aa,
	Abstract = {Abstract: Many modern chemoinformatics systems for small molecules rely on large fingerprint vector representations, where the components of the vector record the presence or number of occurrences in the molecular graphs of particular combinatorial features, such as labeled paths or labeled trees. These large fingerprint vectors are often compressed to much shorter fingerprint vectors using a lossy compression scheme based on a simple modulo procedure. Here, we combine statistical models of fingerprints with integer entropy codes, such as Golomb and Elias codes, to encode the indices or the run lengths of the fingerprints. After reordering the fingerprint components by decreasing frequency order, the indices are monotone-increasing and the run lengths are quasi-monotone-increasing, and both exhibit power-law distribution trends. We take advantage of these statistical properties to derive new efficient, lossless, compression algorithms for monotone integer sequences: monotone value (MOV) coding and monotone length (MOL) coding. In contrast to lossy systems that use 1024 or more bits of storage per molecule, we can achieve lossless compression of long chemical fingerprints based on circular substructures in slightly over 300 bits per molecule, close to the Shannon entropy limit, using a MOL Elias Gamma code for run lengths. The improvement in storage comes at a modest computational cost. Furthermore, because the compression is lossless, uncompressed similarity (e.g., Tanimoto) between molecules can be computed exactly from their compressed representations, leading to significant improvements in retrival performance, as shown on six benchmark data sets of druglike molecules.},

	Abstract = {Abstract: We introduce the principles and the architecture of a user-friendly software named MOLDIA (Molecular Diversity Analysis) which aims to the comparison of diverse molecular data sets through an XML structured database of predefined fragments. The MOLDIA descriptors are composed of complex fingerprint-like structures, which enclose not only structural information but also physicochemical property data. The system architecture includes the use of customizable weights on molecular descriptors and different choices of similarity/diversity measures to analyze the given data sets. Intermolecular comparisons using Ullmann's algorithm were optimized by the use of fuzzy logic, generic atoms, and a whole system of chemical graph analysis. We have found that customizing the similarity/diversity computation using structural and/or properties weights and choosing the level of fuzziness of the molecular comparison allow the user to adapt the tool to particular needs and increases the possibilities of MolDiA applications. The implementation of XML Web technologies has proven to improve and ease the extraction, processing, and analysis of chemical information.},

The techniques are tested using two different biological systems, with particular emphasis on their potential utility as methods for prescreening shape-based database searches. Results are compared with data sets produced using the DOCK program. We find that such similarity evaluations are useful for finding molecules with complementary shape, and that they contain an enriched number of potential DOCK kits-when compared to the original databases. Significant limitations in the utility of such DOCK prescreens are discussed, and potential solutions are considered.},

	Abstract = {Motivation: The development of chemoinformatics has been hampered by the lack of large, publicly available, comprehensive repositories of molecules, in particular of small molecules. Small molecules play a fundamental role in organic chemistry and biology. They can be used as combinatorial building blocks for chemical synthesis, as molecular probes in chemical genomics and systems biology, and for the screening and discovery of new drugs and other useful compounds.

Results: We describe ChemDB, a public database of small molecules available on the Web. ChemDB is built using the digital catalogs of over a hundred vendors and other public sources and is annotated with information derived from these sources as well as from computational methods, such as predicted solubility and three-dimensional structure. It supports multiple molecular formats and is periodically updated, automatically whenever possible. The current version of the database contains approximately 4.1 million commercially available compounds and 8.2 million counting isomers. The database includes a user-friendly graphical interface, chemical reactions capabilities, as well as unique search capabilities.},

	Abstract = {Abstract~~We investigate the use of different Machine Learning methods to construct models for aqueous solubility. Models are based on about 4000 compounds, including an in-house set of 632 drug discovery molecules of Bayer Schering Pharma. For each method, we also consider an appropriate method to obtain error bars, in order to estimate the domain of applicability (DOA) for each model. Here, we investigate error bars from a Bayesian model (Gaussian Process (GP)), an ensemble based approach (Random Forest), and approaches based on the Mahalanobis distance to training data (for Support Vector Machine and Ridge Regression models). We evaluate all approaches in terms of their prediction accuracy (in cross-validation, and on an external validation set of 536 molecules) and in how far the individual error bars can faithfully represent the actual prediction error. },

	Abstract = {A new method for analyzing a structure-activity relationship is proposed. By use of a simple quantitative index, one can readily identify "structure-activity cliffs": pairs of molecules which are most similar but have the largest change in activity. We show how this provides a graphical representation of the entire SAR, in a way that allows the salient features of the SAR to be quickly grasped. In addition, the approach allows us view the SARs in a data set at different levels of detail. The method is tested on two data sets that highlight its ability to easily extract SAR information. Finally, we demonstrate that this method is robust using a variety of computational control experiments and discuss possible applications of this technique to QSAR model evaluation.},

	Abstract = {The global set of relationships between protein targets of all drugs and all disease-gene products in the human protein--protein interaction or 'interactome' network remains uncharacterized. We built a bipartite graph composed of US Food and Drug Administration--approved drugs and proteins linked by drug--target binary associations. The resulting network connects most drugs into a highly interlinked giant component, with strong local clustering of drugs of similar types according to Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical classification. Topological analyses of this network quantitatively showed an overabundance of 'follow-on' drugs, that is, drugs that target already targeted proteins. By including drugs currently under investigation, we identified a trend toward more functionally diverse targets improving polypharmacology. To analyze the relationships between drug targets and disease-gene products, we measured the shortest distance between both sets of proteins in current models of the human interactome network. Significant differences in distance were found between etiological and palliative drugs. A recent trend toward more rational drug design was observed.},

	Abstract = {We present structure-activity relationship (SAR) maps, a new, intuitive method for visualizing SARs targeted specifically at medicinal chemists. The method renders an R-group decomposition of a chemical series as a rectangular matrix of cells, each representing a unique combination of R-groups and thus a unique compound. Color-coding the cells by chemical property or biological activity allows patterns to be easily identified and exploited. SAR maps allow the medicinal chemist to interactively analyze complicated datasets with multiple R-group dimensions, rapidly correlate substituent structure and biological activity, assess additivity of substituent effects, identify missing analogs and screening data, and create compelling graphical representations for presentation and publication. We believe that this method fills a long-standing gap in the medicinal chemist's toolset for understanding and rationalizing SAR.},

	Abstract = {We present the first method to predict compound recovery rates from descriptor statistics. A log-odds function is designed that models probability distributions of descriptor values of active and inactive molecules in chemical space and used to determine the likelihood of database compounds to exhibit a specific activity. The divergence of probability models for active and inactive compounds is applied to evaluate the ability of the log-odds likelihood function to recover active compounds from a background database. The divergence measure, which is closely related to the Kullback-Leibler distance, is strongly correlated with recovery rates of Bayesian virtual screening calculations. It has thus been possible to predict compound recovery rates for different activity classes. Prior to practical virtual screening trials, one can also estimate how likely it would be to recover active compounds from a given screening database.},

@article{Swamidass:2007aa,
	Abstract = {In many modern chemoinformatics systems, molecules are represented by long binary fingerprint vectors recording the presence or absence of particular features or substructures, such as labeled paths or trees, in the molecular graphs. These long fingerprints are often compressed to much shorter fingerprints using a simple modulo operation. As the length of the fingerprints decreases, their typical density and overlap tend to increase, and so does any similarity measure based on overlap, such as the widely used Tanimoto similarity. Here we show that this correlation between shorter fingerprints and higher similarity can be thought of as a systematic error introduced by the fingerprint folding algorithm and that this systematic error can be corrected mathematically. More precisely, given two molecules and their compressed fingerprints of a given length, we show how a better estimate of their uncompressed overlap, hence of their similarity, can be derived to correct for this bias. We show how the correction can be implemented not only for the Tanimoto measure but also for all other commonly used measures. Experiments on various data sets and fingerprint sizes demonstrate how, with a negligible computational overhead, the correction noticeably improves the sensitivity and specificity of chemical retrieval.},

@article{Rucker:2007aa,
	Abstract = {Abstract: y-Randomization is a tool used in validation of QSPR/QSAR models, whereby the performance of the original model in data description (r2) is compared to that of models built for permuted (randomly shuffled) response, based on the original descriptor pool and the original model building procedure. We compared y-randomization and several variants thereof, using original response, permuted response, or random number pseudoresponse and original descriptors or random number pseudodescriptors, in the typical setting of multilinear regression (MLR) with descriptor selection. For each combination of number of observations (compounds), number of descriptors in the final model, and number of descriptors in the pool to select from, computer experiments using the same descriptor selection method result in two different mean highest random r2 values. A lower one is produced by y-randomization or a variant likewise based on the original descriptors, while a higher one is obtained from variants that use random number pseudodescriptors. The difference is due to the intercorrelation of real descriptors in the pool. We propose to compare an original model's r2 to both of these whenever possible. The meaning of the three possible outcomes of such a double test is discussed. Often y-randomization is not available to a potential user of a model, due to the values of all descriptors in the pool for all compounds not being published. In such cases random number experiments as proposed here are still possible. The test was applied to several recently published MLR QSAR equations, and cases of failure were identified. Some progress also is reported toward the aim of obtaining the mean highest r2 of random pseudomodels by calculation rather than by tedious multiple simulations on random number variables.},

	Abstract = {Abstract: Compound subsets, which may be screened where it is not feasible or desirable to screen all available compounds, may be designed using rational or random selection. Literature on the relative performance of random versus rational selection reports conflicting observations, possibly because some random subsets might be more representative than others and perform better than subsets designed by rational means, or vice versa. In order to address this likelihood, we simulated a large number of rationally designed subsets for evaluation against an equally large number of randomly generated subsets. We found that our rationally designed subsets give higher mean hit rates compared to those of the random ones. We also compared subsets comprising random plates with subsets of random compounds and found that, while the mean hit rate of both is the same, the former demonstrates more variation in the hit rate. The choice of compound file, rational subset method, and ratio of the subset size to the compound file size are key factors in the relative performance of random and rational selection, and statistical simulation is a viable way to identify the selection approach appropriate for a subset.},

	Abstract = {Abstract: Identification of the druggable concavity, in which drug-like molecules are highly inclined to bind, is an important step in structure-based drug design. We previously proposed an index named PLB (propensity for ligand binding), which is based on the amino acid composition characteristically observed at the small molecule binding sites in the X-ray structures of the complexes between proteins and drug-like small molecules. The PLB index was proven to be useful in identifying the druggable concavities in the quality X-ray structures of proteins. Here, we apply the PLB to predicting the druggable concavity in target proteins using the structures of homologous proteins constructed by homology modeling. In this study, we assembled a set of reference proteins that were accurately determined by X-ray analysis in forms of complexes with drug-like small molecules. Homology models for the reference protein were constructed using multiple homologous proteins as templates. The PLB index was then used to predict the druggable concavity. If the template protein in a complex with a drug-like small molecule was used, the druggable concavity was predicted well, with a prediction rate of 78%. When only the apo protein was available as the template, the practical prediction rate was 71%. Interestingly, even when the percent sequence identity between the reference and template proteins was lower than 30, the PLB index could successfully identify the druggable concavity in some cases. This study demonstrates the practical value of applying the PLB index to identifying the drugabble concavity in the homology model.},

	Abstract = {Abstract: Protein kinases have emerged as one of the major drug target classes that are amenable to the development of small molecule inhibitors. They share a conserved structural similarity in the region of the ATP binding site, where most inhibitors interact. Using a pharmacophore approach, we have explored the features of protein-ligand interactions for a set of 220 kinase crystal structures from the Protein Data Bank (PDB). The resulting "pharmacophore map" shows the interactions made by all ligands with their receptors simultaneously. This gives insight that has been applied in the design of kinase screening sets and combinatorial libraries. An algorithm is described that scores small molecule structures for goodness of fit to the resulting binding site description obtained from the analysis. The algorithm identifies a pose that is close to the crystal structure pose for the majority of ligands, with only the 2D chemical structure as input and no knowledge of the crystal structure from which it was derived. Application of the algorithm to a test screening set gave a useful enrichment of active compounds.},

	Abstract = {The U.S. National Cancer Institute has used a panel of 60 diverse human cancer cell lines (the NCI-60) to screen >100,000 chemical compounds for anticancer activity. However, not all important cancer types are included in the panel, nor are drug responses of the panel predictive of clinical efficacy in patients. We asked, therefore, whether it would be possible to extrapolate from that rich database (or analogous ones from other drug screens) to predict activity in cell types not included or, for that matter, clinical responses in patients with tumors. We address that challenge by developing and applying an algorithm we term "coexpression extrapolation" (COXEN). COXEN uses expression microarray data as a Rosetta Stone for translating from drug activities in the NCI-60 to drug activities in any other cell panel or set of clinical tumors. Here, we show that COXEN can accurately predict drug sensitivity of bladder cancer cell lines and clinical responses of breast cancer patients treated with commonly used chemotherapeutic drugs. Furthermore, we used COXEN for in silico screening of 45,545 compounds and identify an agent with activity against human bladder cancer.},

	Abstract = {Computational toxicology is emerging as an encouraging alternative to experimental testing. The Molecular Libraries Screening Center Network (MLSCN) as part of the NIH Molecular Libraries Roadmap has recently started generating large and diverse screening datasets, which are publicly available in PubChem. In this report, we investigate various aspects of developing computational models to predict cell toxicity based on cell proliferation screening data generated in the MLSCN. By capturing feature-based information in those datasets, such predictive models would be useful in evaluating cell-based screening results in general (for example from reporter assays) and could be used as an aid to identify and eliminate potentially undesired compounds. Specifically we present the results of random forest ensemble models developed using different cell proliferation datasets and highlight protocols to take into account their extremely imbalanced nature. Depending on the nature of the datasets and the descriptors employed we were able to achieve percentage correct classification rates between 70% and 85% on the prediction set, though the accuracy rate dropped significantly when the models were applied to in vivo data. In this context we also compare the MLSCN cell proliferation results with animal acute toxicity data to investigate to what extent animal toxicity can be correlated and potentially predicted by proliferation results. Finally, we present a visualization technique that allows one to compare a new dataset to the training set of the models to decide whether the new dataset may be reliably predicted.},

	Abstract = {Interest in mapping the global distribution of malaria is motivated by a need to define populations at risk for appropriate resource allocation(1,2) and to provide a robust framework for evaluating its global economic impact(3,4). Comparison of older(5-7) and more recent(1,4) malaria maps shows how the disease has been geographically restricted, but it remains entrenched in poor areas of the world with climates suitable for transmission. Here we provide an empirical approach to estimating the number of clinical events caused by Plasmodium falciparum worldwide, by using a combination of epidemiological, geographical and demographic data. We estimate that there were 515 ( range 300 - 660) million episodes of clinical P. falciparum malaria in 2002. These global estimates are up to 50\% higher than those reported by the World Health Organization ( WHO) and 200\% higher for areas outside Africa, reflecting the WHO's reliance upon passive national reporting for these countries. Without an informed understanding of the cartography of malaria risk, the global extent of clinical disease caused by P. falciparum will continue to be underestimated.},

	Abstract = {Abstract: Structure-activity relationships (SARs) can display very different features. Small chemical modifications of active molecules often dramatically alter biological responses. By contrast, structurally diverse molecules can have similar activity. SARs can also be heterogeneous in nature. For example, for structurally diverse molecules with similar activity, closely related analogs might have significant differences in potency. Given the inherent complexity of SARs, it has been very difficult to estimate SAR characteristics from molecular structure. On the basis of systematic correlation of 2D structural similarity and compound potency, we have developed a function termed "SAR Index" that quantitatively describes the nature of SARs and establishes different SAR categories: continuous, discontinuous, heterogeneous-relaxed, and heterogeneous-constrained. These heterogeneous SAR categories are described for the first time. Given a set of active compounds and their potency values, SAR Index calculations can estimate how likely it is to identify structurally distinct molecules having similar activity.},

	Abstract = {Secondary metabolites from plants serve as defense against herbivores, microbes, viruses, or competing plants. Many medicinal plants have pharmacological activities and may, thus, be a source for novel treatment strategies. During the past 10 years, we have systematically analyzed medicinal plants used in traditional Chinese medicine and focused our interest on Artemisia annua L. (qinhao, sweet wormwood). We found that the active principle of Artemisia annua L., artemisinin, exerts not only antimalarial activity but also profound cytotoxicity against tumor cells. The inhibitory activity of artemisinin and its derivatives towards cancer cells is in the nano- to micromolar range. Candidate genes that may contribute to the sensitivity and resistance of tumor cells to artemisinins were identified by pharmacogenomic and molecular pharmacological approaches. Target validation was performed using cell lines transfected with candidate genes or corresponding knockout cells. The identified genes are from classes with diverse biological functions; for example, regulation of proliferation (BUB3, cyclins, CDC25A), angiogenesis (vascular endothelial growth factor and its receptor, matrix metalloproteinase-9, angiostatin, thrombospondin-1) or apoptosis (BCL-2, BAX, NF-kappa B). Artesunate triggers apoptosis both by p53-dependent and -independent pathways. Antioxidant stress genes (thioredoxin, catalase, gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase, glutathione S-transferases) as well as the epidermal growth factor receptor confer resistance to artesunate. Cell lines overexpressing genes that confer resistance to established antitumor drugs (MDR1, MRP1, BCRP, dihydrofolate reductase, ribonucleotide reductase) were not cross-resistant to artesunate, indicating that artesunate is not involved in multidrug resistance. The anticancer activity of artesunate has also been shown in human xenograft tumors in mice. First encouraging experience in the clinical treatment of patients suffering from uveal melanoma calls for comprehensive clinical trials with artesunate for cancer treatment in the near future.},

	Abstract = {Falcipain-2 (FP2), the major cysteine protease of the human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum, is a hemoglobinase and promising drug target. Here we report the crystal structure of FP2 in complex with a protease inhibitor, cystatin. The FP2 structure reveals two previously unclescribed cysteine protease structural motifs, designated FP2(nose) and FP2(arm), in addition to details of the active site that will help focus inhibitor design. Unlike most cysteine proteases, FP2 does not require a prodomain but only the short FP2(nose) motif to correctly fold and gain catalytic activity. Our structure and mutagenesis data suggest a molecular basis for this unique mechanism by highlighting the functional role of two Tyr within FP2(nose) and a conserved Glu outside this motif. The FP2arm motif is required for hemoglobinase activity. The structure reveals topographic features and a negative charge cluster surrounding FP2(arm) that suggest it may serve as an exo-site for hemoglobin binding. Motifs similar to FP2(nose) and FP2(arm) are found only in related plasmodial proteases, suggesting that they confer malaria-specific functions.},

	Abstract = {The Plasmodium falciparum cysteine peptidases FP-2 (falcipain-2) and FP-3 (falcipain-3), members of the papain-like CAC1 family, are essential haemoglobinases and are therefore potential anti-malarial drug targets. To facilitate a rational drug discovery programme, in the current study we analysed the synthetic substrate and model inhibitor profiles of FP-2 and FP-3 as well as BP-2 (berghepain-2), an orthologue from the rodent parasite Plasmodium berghei. With respect to substrate catalysis, FP-2 exhibited a promiscuous substrate profile based around a consensus non-primeside motif, FP-3 was somewhat more restricted and BP-2 was comparatively specific. Substrate turnover for FP-2 was driven by a basic or acidic P I residue, whereas for FP-3 turnover occurred predominately through a basic P1 residue only, and for BP-2, turnover was again mainly through a basic P I residue for some motifs and surprisingly a glycine in the PI position for other motifs. Within these PI binding elements, additional recognition motifs were observed with subtle nuances that switched substrate turnover on or off through specific synergistic combinations. The peptidases were also profiled against reversible and irreversible cysteine peptidase inhibitors. The results re-iterated the contrasting kinetic behaviour of each peptidase as observed through the substrate screens. The results showed that the substrate and inhibitor preferences of BP-2 were markedly different from those of FP-2 and FP-3. When FP-2 and FP-3 were compared to each other they also displayed similarities and some significant differences. In conclusion, the in vitro data highlights the current difficulties faced by a peptidase directed anti-malarial medicinal chemistry programme where compounds need to be identified with potent activity against at least three peptidases, each of which displays distinct biochemical traits.},

	Abstract = {Erythrocytic stages of the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum express four related papain-family cysteine proteases, termed falcipains. Falcipain-2 and falcipain-3 are food vacuole hemoglobinases, but determination of the specific roles of these and other falcipains has been incomplete. To better characterize biological roles, we attempted disruption of each falcipain gene in the same strain (3D7) of P falciparum. Disruption of falcipain-1, falcipain-2, and falcipain-2' was achieved. In each case knockouts multiplied at the same rate as wild-type parasites. The morphologies of erythrocytic falcipain-1 and falcipain-2' knockout parasites were indistinguishable from those of wild-type parasites. In contrast, consistent with previous results, falcipain-2 knockout trophozoites developed swollen, hemoglobin-filled food vacuoles, indicative of a block in hemoglobin hydrolysis and were, compared to wild-type parasites, twice as sensitive to cysteine protease inhibitors and over 1000 times more sensitive to an aspartic protease inhibitor. The falcipain-3 gene could not be disrupted, but replacement with a tagged functional copy was readily achieved, strongly suggesting that falcipain-3 is essential to erythrocytic parasites. Our data suggest key roles for falcipain-2 and falcipain-3 in the development of erythrocytic malaria parasites and a complex interplay between P. falciparum cysteine and aspartic proteases.

	Abstract = {With annual death tolls in the millions and emerging resistance to existing drugs, novel therapies are needed against malaria. Wiesner et al. recently developed a novel class of antimalarials derived from farnesyltransferase inhibitors based on a 2,5-diaminobenzophenone scaffold. The compounds displayed a wide range of activity, including submicromolar, against the multi-drug resistant Plasmodium falciparum strain Dd2. In order to investigate quantitatively the local physicochemical properties involved in the interaction between drug and biotarget, we used the 3D-QSAR methods CoMFA and CoMSIA to study some of the series, including the screened lead compound 2,5-bis-acylaminobenzophenone, 28 cinnamic acid derivatives, 29 N-(3-benzoyl-4-tolylacetylaminophenyl)-3-(5-aryl-2-furyl)acrylic acid amides, and 34 N-(4-substituted-amino-3-benzoylphenyl)-[5-(4-nitrophenyl)2-furyl]acrylic acid amides. We found that steric, electrostatic, and hydrophobic properties of substituent groups play key roles in the bioactivity of the series of compounds, while hydrogen bonding interactions show no obvious impact. We built several highly predictive 3D-QSAR models, including a CoMSIA one composed of steric, electrostatic, and hydrophobic fields, with r(2) = 0.94, q(2) = 0.63, and r(pred)(2) = 0.63. The results provide insight for optimization of this class of antimalarials for better activity and may prove helpful for further lead optimization. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	Abstract = {The substituted benzimidazoles omeprazole, lansoprazole, rabeprazole, and pantoprazole were found to have in vitro activity against three different isolates of Plasmodium falciparum: D6 (which is chloroquine and pyrimethamine sensitive), W2 (chloroquine and pyrimethamine resistant), and TM91C235 (multidrug resistant). Lansoprazole and rabeprazole were the most effective against all three isolates, with a 50\% inhibitory concentration (IC50) range of 7 to 11 muM. Omeprazole showed intermediate activity against D6 and W2 isolates, with IC(50)s of 27 to 28 muM, but had poor activity against TM91C235, with an IC50 of 76 muM. Pantoprazole was the least effective, with IC(50)s of 73 muM against D6, 53 muM against W2, and 39 muM against TM91C235. A pharmacophore model describing the important features responsible for potent activity of the drugs was developed using computational techniques of semiempirical quantum chemical methods and the three-dimensional QSAR procedure of the CATALYST software. The important features of the pharmacophore, according to the findings based on the CATALYST procedures, are the hydrogen bond acceptor and donor sites at the benzimidine nitrogen atoms and the two aromatic hydrophobic sites in the molecules. AM1 quantum chemical calculations identified the electrostatic potential surface surrounding the sulfoxide atom as crucial for potent activity.},

This resource incorporates the recently completed P. falciparum genome sequence and annotation, as well as draft sequence and annotation emerging from other Plasmodium sequencing projects. PlasmoDB currently houses information from five parasite species and provides tools for intra- and inter-species comparisons. Sequence information is integrated with other genomic-scale data emerging from the Plasmodium research community, including gene expression analysis from EST, SAGE and microarray projects and proteomics studies. The relational schema used to build PlasmoDB, GUS (Genomics Unified Schema) employs a highly structured format to accommodate the diverse data types generated by sequence and expression projects. A variety of tools allow researchers to formulate complex, biologically-based, queries of the database. A stand-alone version of the database is also available on CD-ROM (P. falciparum GenePlot), facilitating access to the data in situations where internet access is difficult (e.g. by malaria researchers working in the field). The goal of PlasmoDB is to facilitate utilization of the vast quantities of genomic-scale data produced by the global malaria research community.

However, deciding which gene products are ideal drug/vaccine targets remains a difficult task. Currently, a systematic disruption of every single gene in Plasmodium is technically challenging. Hence, we have developed a computational approach to prioritize potential targets. A pathway/genome database (PGDB) integrates pathway information with information about the complete genome of an organism. We have constructed PlasmoCyc, a PGDB for Plasmodium falciparum 3D7, using its annotated genomic sequence. In addition to the annotations provided in the genome database, we add 956 additional annotations to proteins annotated as "hypothetical" using the GeneQuiz annotation system. We apply a novel computational algorithm to PlasmoCyc to identify 216 "chokepoint enzymes." All three clinically validated drug targets are "chokepoint enzymes. A total of 87.5\% of proposed drug targets with biological evidence in the literature are chokepoint reactions. Therefore, identifying chokepoint enzymes represents one systematic way to identify potential metabolic drug targets.},

	Abstract = {Falcipains form a class of papain-like cysteine proteases found in Plasmodium falciparum. This group of proteases has been suggested to be promising targets for anti-malarial chemotherapy. Despite being the first falcipain to be identified, the physiological role(s) of falcipain 1 (fp1) remains a mystery. Its suggested functions include haemoglobin degradation, erythrocytic invasion and oocyst production. In this study, the procurement of the gene coding for fp1 and its soluble expression in a heterologous host, Escherichia coli, have enabled further enzyme characterization. The recombinant fp1 protease was found to be unlike falcipain 2 (fp2A) in being more active at neutral pH than at acidic pH against the Z-LR-AMC fluorogenic substrate, suggesting a probable localization in the cytosol and not in the food vacuole. Interestingly, a common cysteine specific inhibitor, E64, did not inhibit fp1 activity, indicating dissimilar biochemical characteristics of fp1 from the other falcipains. This may be explained by computational analysis of the primary structures of the falcipain isozymes, as well as that of papain. The analysis revealed that Tyr61 (papain numbering), which is correspondingly absent in fp1, might be an important residue involved in E64 substrate binding.},

Using plakortin as a novel antimalarial hit, we have prepared a series of semisynthetic derivatives in order to gain insights into the structural requirements of simple 1,2-dioxanes for exhibiting antimalarial activity. Their synthesis, spectroscopic and computational analysis, and in vitro antimalarial activity are herein reported. Results obtained, besides confirming the crucial role of the cycloperoxide functionality, revealed other structural features critical for antimalarial activity, namely the "Western" alkyl side chain, the dioxane ring conformation, and the absolute configuration of the stereogenic carbons on the 1,2-dioxane ring, when affecting the bioactive ring conformation.},

	Abstract = {Merozoite surface protein 1 (MSP1) of the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum is an important vaccine candidate antigen. Antibodies specific for the C-terminal maturation product, MSP1(19), have been shown to inhibit erythrocyte invasion and parasite growth. Specific monoclonal antibodies react with conformational epitopes contained within the two EGF-like domains that constitute the antigen MSP1(19). To gain greater insight into the inhibitory process, the authors selected two strongly inhibitory antibodies (designated 12.8 and 12.10) and modeled their structures by homology. Computational docking was used to generate antigen-antibody complexes and a selection filter based on NMR data was applied to obtain plausible models. Molecular Dynamics simulations of the selected complexes were performed to evaluate the role of specific side chains in the binding. Favorable complexes were obtained that complement the NMR data in defining specific binding sites. These models can provide valuable guidelines for future experimental work that is devoted to the understanding of the action mechanism of invasion-inhibitory antibodies. Proteins 2007;66:513-527.

	Abstract = {Adenosine deaminases (ADAs) from human, bovine, and Plasmodium falciparum sources were analyzed by kinetic isotope effects (KIEs) and shown to have distinct but related transition states. Human adenosine deaminase (HsADA) is present in most mammalian cells and is involved in B- and T-cell development. The ADA from Plasmodium falciparum (PfADA) is essential in this purine auxotroph, and its inhibition is expected to have therapeutic effects for malaria. Therefore, ADA is of continuing interest for inhibitor design. Stable structural mimics of ADA transition states are powerful inhibitors. Here we report the transition-state structures of PfADA, HsADA, and bovine ADA (BtADA) solved using competitive kinetic isotope effects (KIE) and density functional calculations. Adenines labeled at [6-C-13], [6-N-15], [6-C-13, 6-N-15], and [1-N-15] were synthesized and enzymatically coupled with [1'-C-14] ribose to give isotopically labeled adenosines as ADA substrates for KIE analysis. [6-C-13], [6-N-15], and [1-N-15]adenosines reported intrinsic KIE values of (1.010, 1.011, 1.009), (1.005, 1.005, 1.002), and (1.004, 1.001, 0.995) for PfADA, HsADA, and BtADA, respectively. The differences in intrinsic KIEs reflect structural alterations in the transition states. The [1-N-15] KIEs and computational modeling results indicate that PfADA, HsADA, and BtADA adopt early SNAr transition states, where N1 protonation is partial and the bond order to the attacking hydroxyl nucleophile is nearly complete. The key structural variation among PfADA, HsADA, and BtADA transition states lies in the degree of N1 protonation with the decreased bond lengths of 1.92, 1.55, and 1.28 angstrom, respectively. Thus, PfADA has the earliest and BtADA has the most developed transition state. This conclusion is consistent with the 20-36-fold increase of k(cat) in comparing PfADA with HsADA and BtADA.},

	Abstract = {In an effort to enhance access to information available in the National Cancer Institute's (NCI) anticancer drug-screening database, a new suite of Internet accessible (http://spheroid.ncifcrf.gov) computational tools has been assembled for self-organizing map-based (SOM) cluster analysis and data visualization. A range of analysis questions were initially addressed to evaluate improvements in SOM cluster quality based on the data-conditioning procedures of Z-score normalization, capping, and treatment of missing data as well as completeness of drug cell-screening data. These studies established a foundation for SOM cluster analysis of the complete set of NCIs publicly available antitumor drug-screening data. This analysis identified relationships between chemotypes of screened agents and their effect on four major classes of cellular activities: mitosis, nucleic acid synthesis, membrane transport and integrity, and phosphatase- and kinase-mediated cell cycle regulation. Validations of these cellular activities, obtained from literature sources, found (i) strong evidence supporting within cluster memberships and shared cellular activity, (ii) indications of compound selectivity between various types of cellular activity, and (iii) strengths and weaknesses of the NCI's antitumor drug screen data for assigning compounds to these classes of cellular activity. Subsequent analyses of averaged responses within these tumor panel types find a strong dependence on chemotype for coherence among cellular response patterns. The advantages of a global analysis of the complete screening data set are discussed.},

Our analysis proposes strategies to globally assess compounds tested in the NCI's 60-cell (NCI60) in vitro anticancer screen in terms of structural features, biological activity, target specificity, and mechanism of action by data integration via our self-organizing maps of structural and biological response patterns. We have built statistical models to predict compound potency and HF activity based on physicochemical properties. Our results find that it is the combination of different structural properties that determines a compound's biological activity. A direct correlation is also found between compound potency and specificity, indicating that specific targeting, rather than promiscuous poisoning, gives rise to potency. Finally, we offer a strategy to exploit this relationship for future mining of novel anticancer candidates.},

	Abstract = {Developing a model for predicting anticancer activity of any classes of organic compounds based on molecular structure is very important goal for medicinal chemist. Different molecular descriptors can be used to solve this problem. Stochastic molecular descriptors so-called the MARCH-INSIDE approach, shown to be very successful in drug design. Nevertheless, the structural diversity of compounds is so vast that we may need non-linear models such as artificial neural networks (ANN) instead of linear ones. SmartMLP-ANN analysis used to model the anticancer activity of organic compounds has shown high average accuracy of 93.79\% (train performance) and predictability of 90.88\% (validation performance) for the 8:3-MLP topology with different training and predicting series. This ANN model favourably compares with respect to a previous linear discriminant analysis (LDA) model [H. Gonzalez-Diaz et al., J. Mol. Model 9 (2003) 395] that showed only 80.49\% of accuracy and 79.34\% of predictability. The present SmartMLP approach employed shorter training times of only 10 h while previous models give accuracies of 70-89\% only after 25-46 h of training. In order to illustrate the practical use of the model in bioorganic medicinal chemistry, we report the in silico prediction, and in vitro evaluation of six new synthetic tegafur analogues having IC50 values in a broad range between 37.1 and 138 mu g mL(-1) for leukemia (L1210/0) and human T-lymphocyte (Molt4/C8, CEM/0) cells. Theoretical predictions coincide very well with experimental results. (c) 2006 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.},

	Abstract = {15 human tumour cell lines (lung, breast and colon) have been evaluated for their sensitivity to the quinone based anti-cancer drugs Mitomycin C, Porfiromycin, and E09 (3-hydroxymethyl-5-aziridinyl-l-methyl-2-(IH-indole-4,7-dione)prop-$\beta$-en-$\alpha$-ol). Sensitivity has been compared with the intra-cellular levels of DT-diaphorase, an enzyme thought to be important in the reductive activation of these quinones. No correlation exists between levels of DT-diaphorase and sensitivity to Mitomycin C or Porfiromycin. However, for E09 those cell lines showing highest levels of DT-diaphorase activity tend to be the most sensitive.

	Abstract = {For more than 10 years the National Cancer Institute (NCI) has tested compounds for their ability to inhibit the growth of human tumor cell lines in culture (NCI screen). Work of Ken Paull [J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 81 (1989) 1088] demonstrated that compounds with similar mechanism of cell growth inhibition show similar patterns of activity in the NCI screen. This observation was developed into an algorithm called COMPARE and has been successfully used to predict mechanisms for a wide variety of compounds. More recently, this method has been extended to associate patterns of cell growth inhibition by compounds with measurements of molecular entities (such as gene expression) in the cell lines in the NCI screen. The COMPARE method and associated data are freely available on the Developmental Therapeutics Program (DTP) web site (http://dtp.nei.nih.gov/). Examples of the use of COMPARE on these web pages will be explained and demonstrated. Published by Elsevier Science Inc.},

	Abstract = {Mitochondria are principal mediators of apoptosis and thus can be considered molecular targets for new chemotherapeutic agents in the treatment of cancer. Inhibitors of mitochondrial complex I of the electron transport chain have been shown to induce apoptosis and exhibit antitumor activity. In an effort to find novel complex I inhibitors which exhibited anticancer activity in the NCI's tumor cell line screen, we examined organized tumor cytotoxicity screening data available as SOM (self-organized maps) (http//www.spheroid.ncifcrf.gov) at the developmental therapeutics program (DTP) of the National Cancer Institute (NCI). Our analysis focused on an SOM cluster comprised of compounds which included a number of known mitochondrial complex I (NADH:CoQ oxidoreductase) inhibitors. From these clusters 10 compounds whose mechanism of action was unknown were tested for inhibition of complex I activity in bovine heart sub-mitochondrial particles (SMP) resulting in the discovery that 5 of the 10 compounds demonstrated significant inhibition with IC50's in the nM range for three of the five. Examination of screening profiles of the five inhibitors toward the NCI's tumor cell lines revealed that they were cytotoxic to the leukemia subpanel (particularly K562 cells). Oxygen consumption experiments with permeabilized K562 cells revealed that the five most active compounds inhibited complex I activity in these cells in the same rank order and similar potency as determined with bovine heart SMP. Our findings thus fortify the appeal of mitochondrial complex I as a possible anticancer molecular target and provide a data mining strategy for selecting candidate inhibitors for further testing.

@article{Efferth:2004aa,
	Abstract = {The antimalarial artemisinins also reveal profound cytotoxic activity against tumor cells. Artemisinins harbor an endoperoxide bridge whose cleavage results in the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and/or artemisinin carbon-centered free radicals. Established cancer drugs such as anthracyclines also form ROS and free radicals that are responsible for the cardiotoxicity of anthracyclines. In contrast, artemisinins do not reveal cardiotoxicity. In the present investigation, we compared the cytotoxic activities of different artemisinins (artemisinin, artesunate, arteether, artemether, artemisitene, dihydroartemisinylester stereoisomers) in 60 cell lines of the National Cancer Institute (N.C.I.), USA, with those of anthracyclines (doxorubicin, daunorubicin, 4'-epirubicin, idarubicin, deoxydoxorubicin, trifluoroacetyl-doxorubicin-14-valerate). The inhibition concentration 50\% (IC50) values of artemisinins and anthracyclines were correlated with the mRNA expression of 170 genes involved in oxygen stress response and metabolism as recently determined by microarray analysis and deposited in the N.C.I.'s database (http://dtp.nci.nih.gov). The genes whose expression was significantly linked to cellular drug response in Kendall's tau tests were subjected to hierarchical cluster analysis and cluster image mapping. Mathematical correction for false-positive correlations was done by a false discovery rate algorithm. One cluster contained predominately genes with a relationship to artemisinins and another one genes with a relationship to anthracyclines. In a third cluster, genes correlating to both drug classes were assembled. This indicates that different sets of genes involved in oxidative stress response and metabolism may contribute to the cytotoxic and differing toxic side effects of these drug classes.

	Abstract = {Gene expression profiling of tumors allows the establishment of relationships between gene expression profiles and sensitivity to anticancer drugs. In an attempt to study the molecular determinants of the activity of platinum compounds, we explored the publicly available databases of the National Cancer Institute (NCI; http://dtp.nci.nih.gov), which allow access to the gene expression profiles of the 60 cell lines for which drug cytotoxicity patterns already existed. Using this database, we have conducted an in silico research to identify the genes the expression of which was positively or negatively correlated to the sensitivity to four platinum compounds (cisplatin, carboplatin, oxaliplatin and tetraplatin). Important similarities were noticed between cisplatin and carboplatin on one hand and tetraplatin and oxaliplatin on the other hand. In the restricted panel of 1416 genes and molecular markers, we identified 204 markers, among which 120 corresponded to identified genes, that significantly correlated (P < 0.001) with the cytotoxicity of at least one platinum compound. For example, the functionality of the p53-activated pathway appeared positively correlated with the cytotoxicity of all platinum compounds. More specific are the positive correlations between RAS gene mutations and MYC expression and the cellular sensitivity to oxaliplatin. Among the parameters already known as related to the sensitivity to platinum compounds, we identified, in the complete set of 9400 genes, numerous significant relationships, such as the negative correlations between ERB-B2 and BCL-X-L expressions and the cytotoxicity of the platinum compounds. Public databases mining, therefore, appears to be a valuable tool for the identification of determinants of anticancer drug activity in tumors.},

	Abstract = {The metabolic activation of a variety of quinone-based anticancer agents occurs, in part, as a result of the bioreductive activation by the flavoprotein NAD(P)H:quinone-acceptor oxidoreductase (NQO1) (EC 1.6.99.2). Using the COMPARE algorithm (http://dtp.nci.nih.gov), a significant statistical correlation has been found in the NCI in vitro anticancer drug screen between high endogenous expression of the pro-apoptotic protein BAD, NQO1 enzymatic activity, and the cytotoxicity of certain antitumor quinones. Two statistically correlated groups of quinones can be discerned: positive-correlated compounds, which are more active in cell lines expressing high baseline levels of BAD protein and NQO1 activity (e.g. the MCF-7 breast carcinoma), and negative-correlated compounds, which are more active in cell lines with undetectable levels of BAD and NQO1 activity (e.g. the HL-60 myeloid leukemia). In the present study, the relationship between quinone structure, redox cycling, and cytotoxicity in the MCF-7 and HL-60 cell lines was investigated. A good biological correlation exists between cytotoxicity and NQO1 activity, BAD protein levels and apoptosis, but not always between cytotoxicity and intracellular reactive oxygen species levels. The overall markedly increased cytotoxicity of the aziridinylbenzoquinone compounds used in this study is accompanied by apoptosis, which occurs mostly through a cytochrome c-independent pathway.

It derives predictions for query structures from a database with experimentally determined toxicity data. lazar generates predictions by searching the database for compounds that are similar with respect to a given toxic activity and calculating the prediction from their activities. Apart form the prediction, lazar provides the rationales (structural features and similar compounds) for the prediction and a reliable condence index that indicates, if a query structure falls within the applicability domain of the training database.

Leave-one-out (LOO) crossvalidation experiments were carried out for 10 carcinogenicity endpoints ((female vertical bar male) (hamster vertical bar mouse vertical bar rat) carcinogenicity and aggregate endpoints {hamster vertical bar mouse vertical bar rat} carcinogenicity and rodent carcinogenicity) and Salmonella mutagenicity from the Carcinogenic Potency Database (CPDB). An external validation of Salmonella mutagenicity predictions was performed with a dataset of 3895 structures. Leave-one-out and external validation experiments indicate that Salmonella mutagenicity can be predicted with 85\% accuracy for compounds within the applicability domain of the CPDB. The LOO accuracy of lazar predictions of rodent carcinogenicity is 86\%, the accuracies for other carcinogenicity endpoints vary between 78 and 95\% for structures within the applicability domain.},

	Abstract = {The tissue metabolic simulator (TIMES) modeling approach is a hybrid expert system that couples a metabolic simulator together with structure toxicity rules, underpinned by structural alerts, to predict interaction of chemicals or their metabolites with target macromolecules. Some of the structural alerts representing the reactivity pattern-causing effect could interact directly with the target whereas others necessitated a combination with two- or three-dimensional quantitative structure-activity relationship models describing the firing of the alerts from the rest of the molecules. Recently, TIMES has been used to model bacterial mutagenicity [Mekenyan, O., Dimitrov, S., Serafimova, R., Thompson, E., Kotov, S., Dimitrova, N., and Walker, J. (2004) Identification of the structural requirements for mutagenicity by incorporating molecular flexibility and metabolic activation of chemicals I: TA100 model. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 17 (6), 753-766]. The original model was derived for a single tester strain, Salmonella typhimurium (TA100), using the Ames test by the National Toxicology Program (NTP). The model correctly identified 82% of the primary acting mutagens, 94% of the nonmutagens, and 77% of the metabolically activated chemicals in a training set. The identified high correlation between activities across different strains changed the initial strategic direction to look at the other strains in the next modeling developments. In this respect, the focus of the present work was to build a general mutagenicity model predicting mutagenicity with respect to any of the Ames tester strains. The use of all reactivity alerts in the model was justified by their interaction mechanisms with DNA, found in the literature. The alerts identified for the current model were analyzed by comparison with other established alerts derived from human experts. In the new model, the original NTP training set with 1341 structures was expanded by 1626 proprietary chemicals provided by BASF AG. Eventually, the training set consisted of 435 chemicals, which are mutagenic as parents, 397 chemicals that are mutagenic after S9 metabolic activation, and 2012 nonmutagenic chemicals. The general mutagenicity model was found to have 82% sensitivity, 89% specificity, and 88% concordance for training set chemicals. The model applicability domain was introduced accounting for similarity (structural, mechanistic, etc.) between predicted chemicals and training set chemicals for which the model performs correctly. },

	Abstract = {Abstract: Three different database docking programs (Dock, FlexX, Gold) have been used in combination with seven scoring functions (Chemscore, Dock, FlexX, Fresno, Gold, Pmf, Score) to assess the accuracy of virtual screening methods against two protein targets (thymidine kinase, estrogen receptor) of known three-dimensional structure. For both targets, it was generally possible to discriminate about 7 out of 10 true hits from a random database of 990 ligands. The use of consensus lists common to two or three scoring functions clearly enhances hit rates among the top 5% scorers from 10% (single scoring) to 25-40% (double scoring) and up to 65-70% (triple scoring). However, in all tested cases, no clear relationships could be found between docking and ranking accuracies. Moreover, predicting the absolute binding free energy of true hits was not possible whatever docking accuracy was achieved and scoring function used. As the best docking/consensus scoring combination varies with the selected target and the physicochemistry of target-ligand interactions, we propose a two-step protocol for screening large databases: (i) screening of a reduced dataset containing a few known ligands for deriving the optimal docking/consensus scoring scheme, (ii) applying the latter parameters to the screening of the entire database.},

The relative performance of the programs in reproducing the native ligand conformation from starting SMILES strings for 164 high-resolution protein-ligand complexes is presented and compared. Applying only the native scoring functions, the latest versions of these four docking programs were also used to conduct virtual screening for 12 protein targets of therapeutic interest, involving both publicly available structures and AstraZeneca in-house structures. The capability of the four programs to correctly rank-order target-specific active compounds over alternative binders and nonbinders (decoys plus randomly selected compounds) and thereby enrich a small subset of a screening library is compared. Enrichments from the virtual-screening experiments are contrasted with those obtained with alternative 3D shape-matching and 2D similarity database-search methods.},

Five different protein targets are used, each with several known ligands. The simulated screening deck comprised 1000 molecules from a cleansed version of the MDL drug data report and 49 known ligands. For many of the known ligands, crystal structures of the relevant protein-ligand complexes were available. We attempted to run experiments with each docking method that were as similar as possible. For a given docking method, hit rates were improved versus what would be expected for random selection for most protein targets. However, the ability to prioritize known ligands on the basis of docking poses that resemble known crystal structures is both method- and target-dependent.},

	Abstract = {Abstract: Docking is a computational technique that samples conformations of small molecules in protein binding sites; scoring functions are used to assess which of these conformations best complements the protein binding site. An evaluation of 10 docking programs and 37 scoring functions was conducted against eight proteins of seven protein types for three tasks: binding mode prediction, virtual screening for lead identification, and rank-ordering by affinity for lead optimization. All of the docking programs were able to generate ligand conformations similar to crystallographically determined protein/ligand complex structures for at least one of the targets. However, scoring functions were less successful at distinguishing the crystallographic conformation from the set of docked poses. Docking programs identified active compounds from a pharmaceutically relevant pool of decoy compounds; however, no single program performed well for all of the targets. For prediction of compound affinity, none of the docking programs or scoring functions made a useful prediction of ligand binding affinity.},

	Abstract = {Abstract: When searching for new leads, testing molecules that are too "similar" is wasteful, but when investigating a lead, testing molecules that are "similar" to the lead is efficient. Two questions then arise. Which are the molecular descriptors that should be "similar"? How much "similarity" is enough? These questions are answered by demonstrating that, if a molecular descriptor is to be a valid and useful measure of "similarity" in drug discovery, a plot of differences in its values vs differences in biological activities for a set of related molecules will exhibit a characteristic trapezoidal distribution enhancement, revealing a "neighborhood behavior" for the descriptor. Applying this finding to 20 datasets allows 11 molecular diversity descriptors to be ranked by their validity for compound library design. In order of increasing frequency of usefulness, these are random numbers = log P = MR = strain energy < connectivity indices < 2D fingerprints (whole molecule) = atom pairs = autocorrelation indices < steric CoMFA fields = 2D fingerprints (side chain only) = H-bonding CoMFA fields.},

The mean change indicates the expected magnitude of the change in the property and the number of cases in which the property increases give the probability that the structural transformation will cause the property to increase. Outliers indicate potential ways of avoiding the general trend. Comparing to changes in lipophilicity highlights structural transformations that have unusual effects, some of which can be explained by conformational changes. In this paper, we focus upon the effects on aqueous solubility, plasma protein binding and oral exposure of adding substituents to aromatic rings and methylating heteroatoms.},

	Abstract = {Abstract: The number of non-hydrogen atoms in a molecule, N, appears as a very good molecular descriptor for the toxicity of aliphatic ethers, despite the fact that it does not differentiate among isomers. The regression based on N as a descriptor for the toxicity in mice of 21 alkyl ethers was reported to yield the regression coefficient r = 0.9751. The simple connectivity index 1 produced for the same data a less satisfactory regression: r = 0.9548. To see if variable connectivity index 1f can improve the regression characterized by N we examined the same data using the variable connectivity index 1f as a molecular descriptor. By varying x, y, the variables that discriminate between carbon and oxygen atoms, we obtained regression which approaches in quality the best reported regression using weighted paths as descriptor and which is marginally better than the regression based on N.},

Since QSAR is applicable only to similar compounds, which have similar biological and physicochemical properties, large numbers of compounds are clustered before building local models, and local models are ensembled to obtain the final result.

	Abstract = {Abstract: A simple, highly extensible computational strategy to assess compound toxicity has been developed with the premise that a compound's toxicity can be gauged from the toxicities of structurally similar compounds. Using a reference set of 13645 compounds with reported acute toxicity endpoint dose data (oral, rat-LD50 data normalized in mg/kg), a generic utility which assigns a compound the average toxicity of structurally similar compounds is shown to correlate well with reported values. In a leave-one-out simulation using the requirement that at least one structurally similar member in a "voting consortium" is present within a reference set, the strategy demonstrates a predictive correlation (q2) of 0.82 with 57.3% of the compounds being predicted. Similar leave-one-out simulations on a set of 1781 drugs demonstrate a q2 of 0.74 with 51.8% of the compounds being predicted. Simulations to optimize similarity cutoff definitions, consortium member size, and reference set size illustrate that a significant improvement in the quality and quantity of predictions can be obtained by increasing the reference set size. Similar application of the strategy to subchronic and chronic toxicity data should be possible given reasonably sized reference sets.},

Outliers to this model broadly fell into two groups: small reactive molecules (e.g., acrolein) that were more toxic than predicted and molecules in which the reactive center was sterically hindered by an alkyl group (e.g., 2,4-dimethyl-2,6-heptadienal) that were less toxic than predicted.},

In an independent investigation, we compared the toxicity classification performance of naive Bayesian clustering, k next neighbor classification, and support vector machines. To visualize the chemical space of both toxic and druglike molecules, we trained a large self-organizing map (SOM) with all compounds from the RTECS database and the IDDB. In summary, we found that a support vector machine performed best at classifying compounds of defined toxicity into appropriate toxicity classes. Also. SOMs performed excellently in separating toxic frorn nontoxic substances. Although these two methods are limited to compounds that are structurally similar to known toxic substances, our fragment-based approach extends predictions to compounds that are structurally dissimilar to compounds used in the training set.},

	Abstract = {Toxicity of chemical compound is a complex phenomenon that may be caused by its interaction with different targets in the organism. Two distinct types of toxicity can be broadly specified: the first one is caused by the strong compound's interaction with a single target (e.g. AChE inhibition); while the second one is caused by the moderate compound's interaction with many various targets. Computer program PASS predicts about 2500 kinds of biological activities based on the structural formula of chemical compounds. Prediction is based on the robust analysis of structure-activity relationships for about 60,000 biologically active compounds. Mean accuracy exceeds 90\% in leave-one-out cross-validation. In addition to some kinds of adverse effects and specific toxicity (e.g. carcinogenicity, mutagenicity, etc.), PASS predicts similar to 2000 kinds of biological activities at the molecular level, that providing an estimated profile of compound's action in biological space. Such profiles can be used to recognize the most probable targets, interaction with which might be a reason of compound's toxicity. Applications of PASS predictions for analysis of probable targets and mechanisms of toxicity are discussed.},

	Abstract = {Using the computer system PASS (prediction of activity spectra for substances), which predicts simultaneously several hundreds of biological activities, a training set for discriminating between drugs and nondrugs is created. For the training set, two subsets of databases of drugs and nondrugs (a subset of the World Drug Index, WDI, vs the Available Chemicals Directory, ACD) are used. The high value of prediction accuracy shows that the chemical descriptors and algorithms used in PASS provide highly robust structure-activity relationships and reliable predictions. Compared to other methods applied in this field, the direct benchmark undertaken with this paper showed that the results obtained with PASS are in good accordance with these approaches. In addition, it has been shown that the more specific drug information used in the training set of PASS, the more specific discrimination between drug and nondrug can be obtained.},

	Abstract = {The canonical Wnt-pathway is necessary for gut epithelial cell proliferation and its aberrant activation causes intestinal neoplasia. We report a novel mechanism by which the Sox family of transcription factors regulates the canonical Wnt signaling pathway. We find that some Sox proteins antagonize while others enhance beta-catenin/TCF activity. Sox17, which is expressed in normal gut epithelium but is reduced in intestinal neoplasias, is antagonistic to Wnt signaling. When over-expressed in SW480 colon carcinoma cells, Sox17 represses beta-catenin/TCF activity in a dose-dependent manner and inhibits proliferation. In contrast, Sox4 is expressed in a mutually exclusive domain to Sox17 in normal and neoplastic gut tissue and gain- and loss-of-function studies demonstrate that Sox4 enhances beta-catenin/TCF activity and proliferation of SW480 cells. In addition to binding beta-catenin, both SOX17 and SOX4 physically interact with TCF/LEF family members via their respective HMG box domains. Gain- and loss-of-function experiments suggest that the interaction of SOX proteins with beta-catenin and TCF/LEF proteins regulates their stability. In particular, SOX17 promotes degradation of both beta-catenin and TCF proteins via a non-canonical, GSK3beta-independent mechanism that can be blocked by proteasome inhibitors. In contrast, SOX4 may function to stabilize beta-catenin protein. These findings indicate that SOX proteins can act as both antagonists and agonists of beta-catenin/TCF activity, and this mechanism may regulate Wnt signaling responses in many developmental and disease contexts.},

	Abstract = {The requirement for Notch signaling in vasculogenesis and angiogenesis is well documented. In a previous study, we showed that activation of the Notch pathway in endothelial cells induces differentiation-associated growth arrest; however, the underlying mechanism remains to be elucidated. Here, we show that activation of the Notch pathway by either stimulation of cell surface Notch receptors with crosslinked soluble Delta-like 4 (sDll4)/Jagged1 (sJag1) or constitutive expression of the Notch1 intracellular domain (NIC) suppresses endothelial cell proliferation. This suppression is mediated by the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathways. Following Notch1 activation, both pathways were suppressed in endothelial cells, and alterations in MAPK or PI3K/Akt pathway activity reversed Notch1-induced growth inhibition. Furthermore, we found the effect of Notch1 on endothelial cells to require Mastermind-like (MAML). Overexpression of a dominant-negative mutant of MAML1 antagonized the effects of activated Notch1 on the MAPK and PI3K/Akt pathways. Ectopic expression of Hairy/Enhancer of Split 1 (HES1) consistently reproduced the inhibitory effect of NIC on endothelial cell proliferation. Together, our data demonstrate that the Notch/MAML-HES signaling cascade can regulate both MAPK and PI3K/Akt pathways, which suggests a molecular mechanism for the inhibitory effect of Notch signaling on endothelial cell proliferation.--Liu Z.-J., Xiao M., Balint K., Soma A., Pinnix C. C., Capobianco A. J., Velazquez O. C., Herlyn M. Inhibition of endothelial cell proliferation by Notch1 signaling is medicated by repressing MAPK and PI3K/Akt pathways and rquires MAML1. },

	Abstract = {Rationale The role of Rho/Rho-associated kinase (ROCK) in regulating dendritic and axonal morphology during development has gained much attention. Very little is known, however, about the role of the Rho/ROCK pathway in emotional behavior.

Objective To investigate the role of ROCK in emotional behaviors. We examined how the ROCK inhibitor Y27632 affects the performance of mice on three behavioral tests that measure anxiety-related behaviors.

Results In the elevated plus-maze test, Y27632 (10 nmol, intracerebroventricular) induced a significant decrease in the percentage of time spent in the open arms and in the percentage of entries into open arms. In the fear conditioning test, Y27632-treated mice froze significantly more often and longer than did saline-treated mice. In the hole-board test, Y27632 significantly suppressed head-dipping behavior in Y27632-treated mice than in saline-treated mice. On the other hand, Y27632 did not produce on spontaneous alteration performance in the Y-maze test. These results indicate that ROCK inhibition increased anxiety-related behaviors.

Conclusion Our findings suggest that the ROCK pathway is involved in the expression of anxiety- and fear-related behaviors. Furthermore, we propose that if the Rho/ROCK pathway plays an important role in mediating anxiety-related behaviors in humans, it may prove to be a novel system for anxiolytics to target.},

	Abstract = {Mixed oxygen-ion electronic conductors were prepared starting from the well-established solid electrolyte La0.95Sr0.05Ga0.90Mg0.10O3-delta (LSGM). The adopted strategy involved selective grain boundary doping with iron to form a grain boundary region with high electronic conductivity. Scanning electron microscopy coupled with energy dispersive spectroscopy (SEM/EDS), impedance spectroscopy in air (around 300 degrees C) and high temperature (700-800 degrees C) ac conductivity measurements as a function of po(2) all suggest that this doping strategy was successful. In fact, on increasing the Fe-dopant level, Fe always concentrated along the grain boundary region (as confirmed by SEM/EDS), the total conductivity increased and each individual impedance arc decreased, in agreement with predictions based on the presence of a parallel pathway for electronic transport. Furthermore, the increase in total conductivity (or) with dopant level showed a positive log a versus log Po-2 dependence, typical of hole conductivity. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

 and biology related resources in the last 15 years: thousands of
 scientific journals, databases, wikis, blogs and resources are available with
 a wide variety of types of information. There is a huge need to aggregate
 and organise this information. However, the sheer number of resources makes it
 unrealistic to link them all in a centralised manner. Instead,
 search engines to find information in those resources flourish, and formal
 languages like Resource Description Framework and Web Ontology Language 
 are increasingly used to allow linking of resources.
 A recent development is the use of userscripts to change the appearance of
 web pages, by on-the-fly modification of the web content. This opens
 possibilities to aggregate information and computational results from
 different web resources into the web page of one of those resources.},

	Abstract = {MOTIVATION: Prediction of interactions between proteins and chemical compounds is of great benefit in drug discovery processes. In this field, 3D structure-based methods such as docking analysis have been developed. However, the genomewide application of these methods is not really feasible as 3D structural information is limited in availability. RESULTS: We describe a novel method for predicting protein-chemical interaction using SVM. We utilize very general protein data, i.e. amino acid sequences, and combine these with chemical structures and mass spectrometry (MS) data. MS data can be of great use in finding new chemical compounds in the future. We assessed the validity of our method in the dataset of the binding of existing drugs and found that more than 80% accuracy could be obtained. Furthermore, we conducted comprehensive target protein predictions for MDMA, and validated the biological significance of our method by successfully finding proteins relevant to its known functions.

The application of structural biology to medicinal chemistry has heralded the 'rational drug design' vision of discovering exquisitely selective ligands. However, recent advances in post-genomic biology are indicating that polypharmacology may be a necessary trait for the efficacy of many drugs, therefore questioning the 'one drug, one target' assumption of current rational drug design. By combining advances in chemoinformatics and structural biology, it might be possible to rationally design the next generation of promiscuous drugs with polypharmacology.},

	Abstract = {A new class of distances appropriate for measuring similarity relations between sequences, say one type of similarity per distance, is studied. We propose a new "normalized information distance," based on the noncomputable notion of Kolmogorov complexity, and show that it is in this class and it minorizes every computable distance in the class (that is, it is universal in that it discovers all computable similarities). We demonstrate that it is a metric and call it the similarity metric. This theory forms the foundation for a new practical tool. To evidence generality and robustness, we give two distinctive applications in widely divergent areas using standard compression programs like gzip and GenCompress. First, we compare whole mitochondrial genomes and infer their evolutionary history. This results in a first completely automatic computed whole mitochondrial phylogeny tree. Secondly, we fully automatically compute the language tree of 52 different languages.},

	Abstract = {Some synthetic agonists of the VR1 vanilloid (capsaicin) receptor also inhibit the facilitated transport into cells of the endogenous cannabinoid anandamide (arachidonoylethanolamide, AEA). Here we tested several AEA derivatives containing various derivatized phenyl groups or different alkyl chains as either inhibitors of the AEA membrane transporter (AMT) in intact cells or functional agonists of the VR1 vanilloid receptor in HEK cells transfected with the human VR1. We found that four known AMT inhibitors, AM404, arvanil, olvanil and linvanil, activate VR1 receptors at concentrations 400-10{$[$}punctuation space{$]$}000-fold lower than those necessary to inhibit the AMT. However, we also found three novel AEA derivatives, named VDM11, VDM12 and VDM13, which inhibit the AMT as potently as AM404 but exhibit little or no agonist activity at hVR1. These compounds are weak inhibitors of AEA enzymatic hydrolysis and poor CB1/CB2 receptor ligands. We show for the first time that, despite the overlap between the chemical moieties of AMT inhibitors and VR1 agonists, selective inhibitors of AEA uptake that do not activate VR1 (e.g. VDM11) can be developed.},

@article{Huang:2002aa,
	Abstract = {The vanilloid receptor VR1 is a nonselective cation channel that is most abundant in peripheral sensory fibers but also is found in several brain nuclei. VR1 is gated by protons, heat, and the pungent ingredient of "hot" chili peppers, capsaicin. To date, no endogenous compound with potency at this receptor comparable to that of capsaicin has been identified. Here we examined the hypothesis, based on previous structure-activity relationship studies and the availability of biosynthetic precursors, that N-arachidonoyl-dopamine (NADA) is an endogenous "capsaicin-like" substance in mammalian nervous tissues. We found that NADA occurs in nervous tissues, with the highest concentrations being found in the striatum, hippocampus, and cerebellum and the lowest concentrations in the dorsal root ganglion. We also gained evidence for the existence of two possible routes for NADA biosynthesis and mechanisms for its inactivation in rat brain. NADA activates both human and rat VR1 overexpressed in human embryonic kidney (HEK)293 cells, with potency (EC50 [approx] 50 nM) and efficacy similar to those of capsaicin. Furthermore, NADA potently activates native vanilloid receptors in neurons from rat dorsal root ganglion and hippocampus, thereby inducing the release of substance P and calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) from dorsal spinal cord slices and enhancing hippocampal paired-pulse depression, respectively. Intradermal NADA also induces VR1-mediated thermal hyperalgesia (EC50 = 1.5 {+/-} 0.3 {micro}g). Our data demonstrate the existence of a brain substance similar to capsaicin not only with respect to its chemical structure but also to its potency at VR1 receptors.

@article{Woodcock:2007aa,
	Abstract = {Biomedical science has greatly improved our understanding of pain in recent decades, but few novel molecular entities that address fundamentally new pain mechanisms have entered the clinic, despite dramatically increased pharmaceutical investment. Indeed, virtually all new analgesics approved over the past 25 years are derivatives or reformulations of opioids or aspirin-like drugs, existing drugs given for a new indication or older drugs given by a different route of administration. Here, we discuss factors contributing to this lack of innovation in therapies for pain and advocate public--private partnerships (PPPs) to translate new knowledge into more efficacious and safer treatments.

	Abstract = {The vanilloid receptor-1 (VR1 or TRPV1) is a membrane-bound, nonselective cation channel that is predominantly expressed by peripheral neurons sensing painful stimuli. TRPV1 antagonists produce antihyperalgesic effects in animal models of inflammatory and neuropathic pain. Herein, we describe the synthesis and the structure-activity relationships of a series of 2-(4-pyridin-2-ylpiperazin-1-yl)-1H-benzo[d]imidazoles as novel TRPV1 antagonists. Compound 46ad was among the most potent analogues in this series. This compound was orally bioavailable in rats and was efficacious in blocking capsaicin-induced flinch in rats in a dose-dependent manner. Compound 46ad also reversed thermal hyperalgesia in a model of inflammatory pain, which was induced by complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA).},

	Abstract = {In a cell or microorganism, the processes that generate mass, energy, information transfer and cell-fate specification are seamlessly integrated through a complex network of cellular constituents and reactions. However, despite the key role of these networks in sustaining cellular functions, their large-scale structure is essentially unknown. Here we present a systematic comparative mathematical analysis of the metabolic networks of 43 organisms representing all three domains of life. We show that, despite significant variation in their individual constituents and pathways, these metabolic networks have the same topological scaling properties and show striking similarities to the inherent organization of complex non-biological systems. This may indicate that metabolic organization is not only identical for all living organisms, but also complies with the design principles of robust and error-tolerant scale-free networks, and may represent a common blueprint for the large-scale organization of interactions among all cellular constituents.},

	Abstract = {In this study we evaluate how far the scope of similarity searching can be extended to identify not only ligands binding to the same target as the reference ligand(s) but also ligands of other homologous targets without initially known ligands. This "homology-based similarity searching" requires molecular representations reflecting the ability of a molecule to interact with target proteins. The Similog keys, which are introduced here as a new molecular representation, were designed to fulfill such requirements. They are based only on the molecular constitution and are counts of atom triplets. Each triplet is characterized by the graph distances and the types of its atoms. The atom-typing scheme classifies each atom by its function as H-bond donor or acceptor and by its electronegativity and bulkiness. In this study the Similog keys are investigated in retrospective in silico screening experiments and compared with other conformation independent molecular representations. Studied were molecules of the MDDR database for which the activity data was augmented by standardized target classification information from public protein classification databases. The MDDR molecule set was split randomly into two halves. The first half formed the candidate set. Ligands of four targets (dopamine D2 receptor, opioid delta-receptor, factor Xa serine protease, and progesterone receptor) were taken from the second half to form the respective reference sets. Different similarity calculation methods are used to rank the molecules of the candidate set by their similarity to each of the four reference sets. The accumulated counts of molecules binding to the reference target and groups of targets with decreasing homology to it were examined as a function of the similarity rank for each reference set and similarity method. In summary, similarity searching based on Unity 2D-fingerprints or Similog keys are found to be equally effective in the identification of molecules binding to the same target as the reference set. However, the application of the Similog keys is more effective in comparison with the other investigated methods in the identification of ligands binding to any target belonging to the same family as the reference target. We attribute this superiority to the fact that the Similog keys provide a generalization of the chemical elements and that the keys are counted instead of merely noting their presence or absence in a binary form. The second most effective molecular representation are the occurrence counts of the public ISIS key fragments, which like the Similog method, incorporates key counting as well as a generalization of the chemical elements. The results obtained suggest that ligands for a new target can be identified by the following three-step procedure: 1. Select at least one target with known ligands which is homologous to the new target. 2. Combine the known ligands of the selected target(s) to a reference set. 3. Search candidate ligands for the new targets by their similarity to the reference set using the Similog method. This clearly enlarges the scope of similarity searching from the classical application for a single target to the identification of candidate ligands for whole target families and is expected to be of key utility for further systematic chemogenomics exploration of previously well explored target families.},

	Abstract = {Allosteric inhibition of the hepatitis C virus (HCV) NS5B RNA-dependent RNA polymerase enzyme has recently emerged as a viable strategy toward blocking replication of viral RNA in cell-based systems. We report here 2 series of indole-N-acetamides, bearing physicochemically diverse carboxylic acid replacements, which show potent affinity for the NS5B enzyme with reduced potential for formation of glucuronide conjugates. Preliminary optimization of these series furnished compounds that are potent in the blockade of subgenomic HCV RNA replication in HUH-7 cells.},

	Abstract = {A novel class of 5-cyanopyrimidine-based inhibitors of p38alpha MAP kinase has been investigated. Analogues optimized through SAR iterations display low nanomolar enzymatic and cellular activity. The in vivo efficacy of this class of p38 inhibitors was demonstrated by 3a and 3b (>50% reduction in TNF levels when orally dosed at 5 mg/kg, 5 h prior to LPS administration in an acute murine model of inflammation). For 3a and 3b, the previously identified N-methoxybenzamide moiety (1) was replaced with N-(isoxazol-3-yl)benzamide, thereby providing increased metabolic stability. Cyanopyrimidine 3a demonstrated 100% oral bioavailability in mouse. High p38 kinase selectivity versus over 20 kinases was observed for analogue 3b. Direct hydrogen bonding of the cyano nitrogen of the 5-cyanopyrimidine core to the backbone NH of Met109 was confirmed by X-ray crystallographic analysis of 3a bound to p38alpha.},

@article{Mwense:2006aa,
	Abstract = {The principle of using a singe model to predict the toxicity of mixtures of chemicals based on the characterisation of the degrees of similarity and dissimilarity of the constituent chemicals using descriptors has been demonstrated in a previous work. The current study introduces a feature extraction technique, independent component analysis. to the method to remove the correlations and dependencies between descriptors and reduce the dimension prior to similarity and dissimilarity calculations. in addition, a goal attainment multi-objective optimisation technique is used for the determination of the fuzzy membership function parameters. For three mixtures, which include a new mixture and two previously studied mixtures that all inhibit reproduction (via different mechanisms of action) in green freshwater algae scenedesmus vacuolatus, the approach showed better or equivalent prediction performance than either concentration addition or independent action models. Unlike QSARs for pure compounds that require large collections of data, the new approach for mixtures only requires one mixture at a particular composition to determine the necessary fuzzy membership function parameter values. These values can then be used to predict the toxicity of the mixture at any other compositions. This could potentially lead to a reduction in the frequency of bioassay tests. Use of the fuzzy membership functions and parameter Values obtained for one mixture when used to predict the toxicity of a completely different mixture is also tested and it is found that the approach also gives prediction results with good accuracy.},

	Abstract = {During the past decades, the Quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSARs) have been proven to be reliable tools when little or no empirical data are available in medicinal chemistry, biochemistry, toxicology, and environmental sciences. However, only few studies that quantitatively predict mixtures toxicity have been reported. In this study, the QASR models for the binary mixtures toxicity of 12 benzene and its derivatives, including eight non-polar narcotic compounds and four polar narcotic compounds were developed, without reference to exact toxicity mechanisms of single compounds. All parameters for the QSAR studies were defined on the basis of quantum mechanical calculations and these parameters were selected by the stepwise procedure. The results of this study provided a simple means of predicting the binary mixtures toxicity from the chemical structure. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	Abstract = {Significant progress has been made on predicting dermal absorption/penetration of topically applied compounds by developing QSPR models based on linear free energy relations (LFER). However, all of these efforts have employed compounds applied to the skin in aqueous or single solvent systems, a dosing scenario that does not mimic occupational, environmental or pharmaceutical exposure. We have explored using hybrid QSPR equations describing individual compound penetration based on the molecular descriptors for the compound modified by a mixture factor (MF) which accounts for the physicochemical properties of the vehicle/mixture components. The MF is calculated based on percentage composition of the vehicle/mixture components and physical chemical properties selected using principal components analysis. This model has been applied to 12 different compounds in 24 mixtures for a total of 288 treatment combinations obtained from flow-through porcine skin diffusion cells and in an additional dataset of 10 of the same compounds in five mixtures for a total of 50 treatment combinations in the ex vivo isolated perfused porcine skin flap. The use of the MF in combination with a classic LFER based on penetrant properties significantly improved the ability to predict dermal absorption of compounds dosed in complex chemical mixtures.},

	Abstract = {Target identification is a critical step following the discovery of small molecules that elicit a biological phenotype. The present work seeks to provide an in silico correlate of experimental target fishing technologies in order to rapidly fish out potential targets for compounds on the basis of chemical structure alone. A multiple-category Laplacian-modified naive Bayesian model was trained on extended-connectivity fingerprints of compounds from 964 target classes in the WOMBAT (World Of Molecular BioAcTivity) chemogenomics database. The model was employed to predict the top three most likely protein targets for all MDDR (MDL Drug Database Report) database compounds. On average, the correct target was found 77% of the time for compounds from 10 MDDR activity classes with known targets. For MDDR compounds annotated with only therapeutic or generic activities such as "antineoplastic", "kinase inhibitor", or "anti-inflammatory", the model was able to systematically deconvolute the generic activities to specific targets associated with the therapeutic effect. Examples of successful deconvolution are given, demonstrating the usefulness of the tool for improving knowledge in chemogenomics databases and for predicting new targets for orphan compounds.},

@article{Hewitt:2007aa,
	Abstract = {This study has assessed the use of consensus regression, as compared to single multiple linear regression, models for the development of quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSARs). To provide a comparison, four data sets of varying size and complexity were analyzed: silastic membrane flux, toxicity of phenols to Tetrahymena pyriformis, acute toxicity to the fathead minnow and flash point. For each data set, a genetic algorithm was used to develop a model population and the performance of consensus models was compared to that of the best single model. Two consensus models were developed, one using the top 10 models, and the other using a subset of models chosen to provide maximal coverage of model space. The results highlight the ability of the genetic algorithm to develop predictive models from a large descriptor pool. However, the consensus models were shown to offer no significant improvements over single regression models, which are as statistically robust as the equivalent consensus models. Consensus models developed from a selection of the best QSARs were shown not to be superior to a selection of diverse in "model space" QSARs. For the data sets analyzed in this study, and in light of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development principles for the validation of QSARs, the increase in model complexity when using consensus models does not seem warranted given the minimal improvement in model statistics.},

@article{Crisman:2007aa,
	Abstract = {High throughput screening (HTS) data is often noisy, containing both false positives and negatives. Thus, careful triaging and prioritization of the primary hit list can save time and money by identifying potential false positives before incurring the expense of followup. Of particular concern are cell-based reporter gene assays (RGAs) where the number of hits may be prohibitively high to be scrutinized manually for weeding out erroneous data. Based on statistical models built from chemical structures of 650 000 compounds tested in RGAs, we created "frequent hitter" models that make it possible to prioritize potential false positives. Furthermore, we followed up the frequent hitter evaluation with chemical structure based in silico target predictions to hypothesize a mechanism for the observed "off target" response. It was observed that the predicted cellular targets for the frequent hitters were known to be associated with undesirable effects such as cytotoxicity. More specifically, the most frequently predicted targets relate to apoptosis and cell differentiation, including kinases, topoisomerases, and protein phosphatases. The mechanism-based frequent hitter hypothesis was tested using 160 additional druglike compounds predicted by the model to be nonspecific actives in RGAs. This validation was successful (showing a 50% hit rate compared to a normal hit rate as low as 2%), and it demonstrates the power of computational models toward understanding complex relations between chemical structure and biological function.},

	Abstract = {Strategies are described for constructing pharmacophoric 3D database queries, based on a series of active and inactive analogs. The results are highly selective database queries, which are consistent with the generally accepted pharmacophore for a number of systems. The foundation of these strategies is the method of Mayer, Naylor, Motoc and Marshall [J. Comput.-Aided Mol. Design, 1 (1987) 3] for inferring a unique binding geometry for angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. The strategies described here generalize their approach to cases where the chemical features responsible for binding are not a priori apparent, and to cases where the binding geometry deduced by that method is not unique. The key new insight, the selectivity principle, is to rank the multiple solutions produced by the method of Mayer et al. by their selectivity, a value that is related to the proportion of a database that is returned as a database hit list. Retrospective analyses are described for D2-antagonists, ACE inhibitors, fibrinogen antagonists, and beta 2-antagonists.},

	Abstract = {The prediction of a biological activity using a Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR) model is valid only if the compound in question is inside the model's domain of applicability. The existing methods for determining the domain of applicability in descriptor space suffer from problems including poor handling of nonconvex training sets and computational inefficiency. In this paper, we propose a cluster-based approach to modelling the domain of applicability, which may overcome some of the shortcomings of the existing approaches described. We investigate applying an intelligent version of the K-means clustering algorithm to this problem, modelling the training set as a collection of clusters in the descriptor space. A test compound is assigned fuzzy membership of each individual cluster, from which an overall distance may be calculated. Finally, we experimentally assess how this cluster-based approach compares with the existing methods.},

@article{Zhu:2001aa,
	Abstract = {In an effort to develop a quantitative ligand-binding model for the receptor tyrosine kinases, a pharmacophore search was first used to identify structural features that are common in two novel sets of 12 molecules of the 3-substituted indolin-2-ones and 19 compounds of the benzylidene malononitriles with low-to-high affinity for HER2, a kind of receptor tyrosine kinase. The common pharmacophore model based on these 31 compounds was used as a template to obtain the aligned molecular aggregate, which provided a good starting point for 3D-QSAR analysis of only the 19 benzylidene malononitriles. Two molecular field analysis (MFA) techniques, including CoMFA and CoMSIA, were used to derive the quantitative structure-activity relationships of the studied molecules. From the studied results, it was obvious that the 3D-QSAR models based on the pharmacophore alignment were superior to those based on the simple atom-by-atom fits. Considering the flexibility of the studied molecules and the difference between the active conformers and the energy-lowest conformers, the pharmacophore model can usually provide the common features for the flexible regions. Moreover, the best CoMSIA model based on the pharmacophore hypothesis gave good statistical measure from partial least-squares analysis (PLS) (q(2) = 0.71), which was slightly better than the CoMFA one. Our study demonstrated that pharmacophore modeling and CoMSIA research could be effectively combined. Results obtained from both methods helped with understanding the specific activity of some compounds and designing new specific HER2 inhibitors.},

@article{Franke:2005aa,
	Abstract = {Support vector machines (SVM) were trained to predict cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) and thrombin inhibitors. The classifiers were obtained using sets of known COX-2 and thrombin inhibitors as "positive examples" and a large collection of screening compounds as "negative examples". Molecules were encoded by topological pharmacophore-point triangles. In retrospective virtual screening, 50-90\% of the known active compounds were listed within the first 0.1\% of the ranked database. To check the validity of the constructed classifiers, we developed a method for feature extraction and visualization using SVM. As a result, potential pharmacophore points were weighted according to their importance for COX-2 and thrombin inhibition. Known thrombin and COX-2 pharmacophore points were correctly recognized by the machine learning system. In a prospective virtual screening study, several potential COX-2 inhibitors were predicted and tested in a cellular activity assay. A benzimidazole derivative exhibited significant inhibitory activity with an IC50 of 0.2 mu M, which is better than Celecoxib in our assay. It was demonstrated that the SVM machine-learning method can be used in virtual screening and be analyzed in a human-interpretable way that results in a set of rules for designing novel molecules.},

@article{Irwin:2005aa,
	Abstract = {A critical barrier to entry into structure-based virtual screening is the lack of a suitable, easy to access database of purchasable compounds. We have therefore prepared a library of 727,842 molecules, each with 3D structure, using catalogs of compounds from vendors (the size of this library continues to grow). The molecules have been assigned biologically relevant protonation states and are annotated with properties such as molecular weight, calculated LogP, and number of rotatable bonds. Each molecule in the library contains vendor and purchasing information and is ready for docking using a number of popular docking programs. Within certain limits, the molecules are prepared in multiple protonation states and multiple tautomeric forms. In one format, multiple conformations are available for the molecules. This database is available for free download (http://zinc.docking.org) in several common file formats including SMILES, mol2, 3D SDF, and DOCK flexibase format. A Web-based query tool incorporating a molecular drawing interface enables the database to be searched and browsed and subsets to be created. Users can process their own molecules by uploading them to a server. Our hope is that this database will bring virtual screening libraries to a wide community of structural biologists and medicinal chemists.},

The initial virtual screening using a ligand-based pharmacophore model identified 95 compounds from an in-house small molecule database of 15,452 compounds. The obtained hits were further evaluated by molecular docking and 15 compounds were short listed based on docking scores and the other scoring functions and subjected to biological assay. Chorismate mutase activity assays identified four compounds as inhibitors of M. tuberculosis chorismate mutase (MtCM) with low K-i values. The structural models for these ligands in the chorismate mutase binding site will facilitate medicinal chemistry efforts for lead optimization against this protein. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

	Abstract = {The flow of information in combinatorial chemistry is much like that which medicinal chemists have traditionally faced; however, the speed and quantity of that flow is much greater. In traditional chemistry, computational tools have been applied essentially as a replacement for Dreiding models; with combi-chem, the use of computational tools now becomes compelling. In our environment, the primary focus is less on the use of combi-chem in the development of universal libraries for screening, and more on its use in the development of targeted libraries. Hence, the four primary challenges we face are: (1) gaining an understanding of the structure-activity relationship (SAR), (2) using that understanding in the iterative design of new targeted libraries, (3) incorporating any structural data into that iterative design process, and (4) registering the compounds produced by combi-chem into a database. For computational tools to be effective, they must address these challenges more quickly and more accurately than the combi-chemist is able to achieve independently, i.e, high-quality answers must be developed in less than a few days. We describe how the first challenge may be addressed by pharmacophore recognition tools (Catalyst, DANTE), how the second and third may be addressed by 3D database searching, and how the fourth may be addressed by 'virtual chemistry' using databases of compounds and tables of reactions which may be applied to those compounds.},

@article{Strobl:2007aa,
	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Variable importance measures for random forests have been receiving increased attention as a means of variable selection in many classification tasks in bioinformatics and related scientific fields, for instance to select a subset of genetic markers relevant for the prediction of a certain disease. We show that random forest variable importance measures are a sensible means for variable selection in many applications, but are not reliable in situations where potential predictor variables vary in their scale of measurement or their number of categories. This is particularly important in genomics and computational biology, where predictors often include variables of different types, for example when predictors include both sequence data and continuous variables such as folding energy, or when amino acid sequence data show different numbers of categories. RESULTS: Simulation studies are presented illustrating that, when random forest variable importance measures are used with data of varying types, the results are misleading because suboptimal predictor variables may be artificially preferred in variable selection. The two mechanisms underlying this deficiency are biased variable selection in the individual classification trees used to build the random forest on one hand, and effects induced by bootstrap sampling with replacement on the other hand. CONCLUSION: We propose to employ an alternative implementation of random forests, that provides unbiased variable selection in the individual classification trees. When this method is applied using subsampling without replacement, the resulting variable importance measures can be used reliably for variable selection even in situations where the potential predictor variables vary in their scale of measurement or their number of categories. The usage of both random forest algorithms and their variable importance measures in the R system for statistical computing is illustrated and documented thoroughly in an application re-analyzing data from a study on RNA editing. Therefore the suggested method can be applied straightforwardly by scientists in bioinformatics research.},

	Abstract = {The use of Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationships in assessing the potential negative effects of chemicals plays an important role in ecotoxicology. (LC50)(96h) in Pimephales promelas (Duluth database) is widely modeled as an aquatic toxicity end-point. The object of this study was to compare different molecular descriptors in the development of new statistically validated QSAR models to predict the aquatic toxicity of chemicals classified according to their MOA and in a unique general model. The applied multiple linear regression approach (ordinary least squares) is based on theoretical molecular descriptor variety (1D, 2D, and 3D, from DRAGON package, and some calculated logP). The best combination of modeling descriptors was selected by the Genetic Algorithm-Variable Subset Selection procedure. The robustness and the predictive performance of the proposed models was verified using both internal (cross-validation by LOO, bootstrap, Y-scrambling) and external statistical validations (by splitting the original data set into training and validation sets by Kohonen-artificial neural networks (K-ANN)). The model applicability domain (AD) was checked by the leverage approach to verify prediction reliability.},

We use our particular case study to illustrate such issues as problem formulation, selection of evaluation measures, and data preparation. We relate these issues to properties of the oil spill application, such as its imbalanced class distribution, that are shown to be common to many applications. Our solutions to these issues are implemented in the Canadian Environmental Hazards Detection System (CEHDS), which is about to undergo field testing.

Although this enrichment is greater than that found with random screening and docking to three-dimensional structures, this low fraction of actives within similar compounds occurs not only because of deficiencies in the Daylight fingerprints and Tanimoto similarity calculations but also because similar compounds do not necessarily interact with the target macromolecule in similar ways. The current study emphasizes the statistical or probabilistic nature of library design and that perfect results cannot be expected.},

	Abstract = {Techniques based on agglomerative hierarchical clustering constitute one of the most frequent approaches in unsupervised clustering. Some are based on the single linkage methodology, which has been shown to produce good results with sets of clusters of various sizes and shapes. However, the application of this type of algorithms in a wide variety of fields has posed a number of problems, such as the sensitivity to outliers and fluctuations in the density of data points. Additionally, these algorithms do not usually allow for automatic clustering.

In this work we propose a method to improve single linkage hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA), so as to circumvent most of these problems and attain the performance of most sophisticated new approaches. This completely automated method is based on a self-consistent outlier reduction approach, followed by the building-up of a descriptive function. This, in turn, allows to define natural clusters. Finally, the discarded objects may be optionally assigned to these clusters.

The validation of the method is carried out by employing widely used data sets available from literature and others for specific purposes created by the authors. Our method is shown to be very efficient in a large variety of situations. },

@article{Raghavendra:2007aa,
	Abstract = {A new method, based on generalized Fourier analysis, is described that utilizes the concept of "molecular basis sets" to represent chemical space within an abstract vector space. The basis vectors in this space are abstract molecular vectors. Inner products among the basis vectors are determined using an ansatz that associates molecular similarities between pairs of molecules with their corresponding inner products. Moreover, the fact that similarities between pairs of molecules are, in essentially all cases, nonzero implies that the abstract molecular basis vectors are nonorthogonal, but since the similarity of a molecule with itself is unity, the molecular vectors are normalized to unity. A symmetric orthogonalization procedure, which optimally preserves the character of the original set of molecular basis vectors, is used to construct appropriate orthonormal basis sets. Molecules can then be represented, in general, by sets of orthonormal "molecule-like" basis vectors within a proper Euclidean vector space. However, the dimension of the space can become quite large. Thus, the work presented here assesses the effect of basis set size on a number of properties including the average squared error and average norm of molecular vectors represented in the space-the results clearly show the expected reduction in average squared error and increase in average norm as the basis set size is increased. Several distance-based statistics are also considered. These include the distribution of distances and their differences with respect to basis sets of differing size and several comparative distance measures such as Spearman rank correlation and Kruscal stress. All of the measures show that, even though the dimension can be high, the chemical spaces they represent, nonetheless, behave in a well-controlled and reasonable manner. Other abstract vector spaces analogous to that described here can also be constructed providing that the appropriate inner products can be directly evaluated as is the case in this work, a problem that is well-known in kernel-based machine learning.},

	Abstract = {The goal of eliminating animal testing in the predictive identification of chemicals with the intrinsic ability to cause skin sensitization is an important target, the attainment of which has recently been brought into even sharper relief by the EU Cosmetics Directive and the requirements of the REACH legislation. Development of alternative methods requires that the chemicals used to evaluate and validate novel approaches comprise not only confirmed skin sensitizers and non-sensitizers but also substances that span the full chemical mechanistic spectrum associated with skin sensitization. To this end, a recently published database of more than 200 chemicals tested in the mouse local lymph node assay (LLNA) has been examined in relation to various chemical reaction mechanistic domains known to be associated with sensitization. It is demonstrated here that the dataset does cover the main reaction mechanistic domains. In addition, it is shown that assignment to a reaction mechanistic domain is a critical first step in a strategic approach to understanding, ultimately on a quantitative basis, how chemical properties influence the potency of skin sensitizing chemicals. This understanding is necessary if reliable non-animal approaches, including (quantitative) structure-activity relationships (Q)SARs, read-across, and experimental chemistry based models, are to be developed.},

	Abstract = {Clustering is a common task in the field of cheminformatics. A key parameter that needs to be set for non-hierarchical clustering methods, such as $k$-means, is the number of clusters, k. Traditionally the value of $k$ is obtained by performing the clustering with different values of $k$ and selecting that value that leads to the optimal clustering. In this study we describe an approach to selecting k, a priori, based on the R-NN curve algorithm described by Guha et al. (J.~Chem.~Inf.~Model., 2006, 46, 1713-1722) which uses a nearest neighbor technique to characterize the spatial location of compounds in arbitrary descriptor spaces. The algorithm generates a set of curves for the dataset which are then analyzed to estimate the natural number of clusters. We then performed k-means clustering with the predicted value of k as well as with similar values to check that the correct number of clusters was obtained. In addition we compared the predicted value to the number indicated by the average silhouette width as a cluster quality measure. We tested the algorithm on simulated data as well as on two chemical datasets. Our results indicate the the R-NN curve algorithm is able to determine the natural number of clusters and is in general agreement the average silhouette width in identifying the optimal number of clusters },

Traditional approaches employ deterministic or stochastic methods to obtain a descriptor subset that leads to an optimal model of a single type (such as linear regression or a neural network). With the development of ensemble modeling approaches, multiple models of differing types are individually developed resulting in different descriptor subsets for each model type. However it is advantageous, from the point of view of developing interpretable QSAR models, to have a single set of descriptors that can be used for different model types. In this paper, we describe an approach to the selection of a single, optimal, subset of descriptors for multiple model types. We apply this approach to three datasets, covering both regression and classification, and show that the constraint of forcing different model types to use the same set of descriptors does not lead to a significant loss in predictive ability for the individual models considered. In addition, interpretations of the individual models developed using this approach indicate that they encode similar structure-activity trends. },

	Abstract = {The flexibility and scope of the R programming environment has made it a popular choice for statistical modeling and scientific prototyping in a number of fields. In the field of chemistry, R provides several tools for a variety of problems related to statistical modeling of chemical information. However, one aspect common to these tools is that they do not have direct access to the information that is available from chemical structures, such as contained in molecular descriptors.

We describe the rcdk package that provides the R user with access to the CDK, a Java framework for cheminformatics. As a result, it is possible to read in a variety of molecular formats, calculate molecular descriptors and evaluate fingerprints. In addition, we describe the rpubchem that will allow access to the data in PubChem, a public repository of molecular structures and associated assay data for approximately 8 million compounds. Currently the package allows access to structural information as well as some simple molecular properties from PubChem. In addition the package allows access to bio-assay data from the PubChem FTP servers. },

Linear regression and nonlinear computational neural network models were developed. The regression model was developed with a focus on interpretative ability using a PLS technique. However, it also exhibits a good predictive ability after outlier removal. The nonlinear CNN model had superior predictive ability compared to the linear model with a training set error of 0.22 log(IC50) units (R2 = 0.93) and a prediction set error of 0.32 log(IC50) units (R2 = 0.61). A random forest model was also developed to provide an alternate measure of descriptor importance. This approach ranks descriptors, and its results confirm the importance of specific descriptors as characterized by the PLS technique. In addition the neural network model contains the two most important descriptors indicated by the random forest model.},

	Abstract = {The determination of the validity of a QSAR model when applied to new compounds is an important concern in the field of QSAR and QSPR modeling. Various scoring techniques can be applied to specific types of models. We present a technique with which we can state whether a new compound will be well predicted by a previously built QSAR model. In this study we focus on linear regression models only, though the technique is general and could also be applied to other types of quantitative models. Our technique is based on a classification method that divides regression residuals from a previously generated model into a good class and bad class and then builds a classifier based on this division. The trained classifier is then used to determine the class of the residual for a new compound. We investigated the performance of a variety of classifiers, both linear and nonlinear. The technique was tested on two data sets from the literature and a hand built data set. The data sets selected covered both physical and biological properties and also presented the methodology with quantitative regression models of varying quality. The results indicate that this technique can determine whether a new compound will be well or poorly predicted with weighted success rates ranging from 73% to 94% for the best classifier.},

	Abstract = {Traditional quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models aim to capture global structure-activity trends present in a data set. In many situations, there may be groups of molecules which exhibit a specific set of features which relate to their activity or inactivity. Such a group of features can be said to represent a local structure-activity relationship. Traditional QSAR models may not recognize such local relationships. In this work, we investigate the use of local lazy regression (LLR), which obtains a prediction for a query molecule using its local neighborhood, rather than considering the whole data set. This modeling approach is especially useful for very large data sets because no a priori model need be built. We applied the technique to three biological data sets. In the first case, the root-mean-square error (RMSE) for an external prediction set was 0.94 log units versus 0.92 log units for the global model. However, LLR was able to characterize a specific group of anomalous molecules with much better accuracy (0.64 log units versus 0.70 log units for the global model). For the second data set, the LLR technique resulted in a decrease in RMSE from 0.36 log units to 0.31 log units for the external prediction set. In the third case, we obtained an RMSE of 2.01 log units versus 2.16 log units for the global model. In all cases, LLR led to a few observations being poorly predicted compared to the global model. We present an analysis of why this was observed and possible improvements to the local regression approach.},

The resultant classification is used to generate training, cross-validation (CV) and prediction sets for QSAR modeling using the ADAPT methodology. The results are compared to those of QSAR models generated using sets created by activity binning and a sphere exclusion method. The results indicate that the SOM is able to generate QSAR sets that are representative of the composition of the overall data set in terms of similarity. The resulting QSAR models are half the size of those published and have comparable RMS errors. Furthermore, the RMS errors of the QSAR sets are consistent, indicating good predictive capabilities as well as generalizability.},

@article{Brisson:2004aa,
	Abstract = {Cdc25A and Cdc25B dual-specificity phosphatases are key regulators of cell cycle transition and proliferation. They have oncogenic properties and are overexpressed in many human tumors. Because selective Cdc25 phosphatase inhibitors would be valuable biological tools and possible therapeutic agents, we have assayed a small molecule library for in vitro inhibition of Cdc25. We now report the identification of two new structurally distinct classes of Cdc25 inhibitors with cellular activity. The cyclopentaquinoline 3a,4,5,9b-tetrahydro-3H-cyclopenta[c]quinoline-4,8-dicarboxylic acid (5661118) and the naphthofurandione 3-benzoyl-naphtho[1,2-b]furan-4,5-dione (5169131) had in vitro IC50 values of 2.5 to 11 microM against recombinant Cdc25 and were less potent inhibitors of other phosphatases. Unlike 5661118, 5169131 caused reversible inhibition of Cdc25B and displayed competitive inhibitor kinetics. No growth inhibitory activity was seen with 5661118, whereas 10 to 30 microM 5169131 caused G1/S and G2/M arrest. We also found that 5169131 inhibited human PC-3 prostate and MDA-MB-435 breast cancer cell proliferation. Concentration-dependent Tyr15 hyperphosphorylation was seen on cyclin-dependent kinase with a 1-h 5169131 treatment, consistent with Cdc25 inhibition. Cells resistant to DNA toposiomerase II inhibitors were as sensitive to 5169131 as parental cells, indicating that this quinone compound does not inhibit topoisomerase II in vivo. Molecular modeling was used to predict a potential interaction site between the inhibitor and Cdc25B and to provide insights as to the molecular origins of the experimental observations. Based on its kinetic profile and cellular activity, we suggest that 5169131 could be an excellent tool for further studies on the cellular roles of Cdc25.},

	Abstract = {Small molecules provide powerful tools to interrogate biological pathways but many important pathway participants remain refractory to inhibitors. For example, Cdc25 dual-specificity phosphatases regulate mammalian cell cycle progression and are implicated in oncogenesis, but potent and selective inhibitors are lacking for this enzyme class. Thus, we evaluated 10,070 compounds in a publicly available chemical repository of the National Cancer Institute for in vitro inhibitory activity against oncogenic, full-length, recombinant human Cdc25B. Twenty-one compounds had mean inhibitory concentrations of <1 microM; >75% were quinones and >40% were of the para-naphthoquinone structural type. Most notable was NSC 95397 (2,3-bis-[2-hydroxyethylsulfanyl]-[1,4]naphthoquinone), which displayed mixed inhibition kinetics with in vitro K(i) values for Cdc25A, -B, and -C of 32, 96, and 40 nM, respectively. NSC 95397 was more potent than any inhibitor of dual specificity phosphatases described previously and 125- to 180-fold more selective for Cdc25A than VH1-related dual-specificity phosphatase or protein tyrosine phosphatase 1b, respectively. Modification of the bis-thioethanol moiety markedly decreased enzyme inhibitory activity, indicating its importance for bioactivity. NSC 95397 showed significant growth inhibition against human and murine carcinoma cells and blocked G(2)/M phase transition. A potential Cdc25 site of interaction was postulated based on molecular modeling with these quinones. We propose that inhibitors based on this chemical structure could serve as useful tools to probe the biological function of Cdc25.},

	Abstract = {The redox capacities of p-benzoquinone (I) and its analogs p-benzoquinone imine (VI) and p-benzoquinone diimine (XI) as the simplest model systems for the biochemically important quinone site of the pharmacophores of the anthracyclines has been investigated by AM1 semi-empirical and ab initio methods. The reductive activation of the parent (Q) model systems to their various redox states (quinone radical anion (Q.-), semiquinone (QH.), semiquinone anion (QH-) and hydroquinone (QH2)), the internal geometrical reorganization and the redox capacities of the redox states have been examined by using energy-partitioning analysis, reaction enthalpies/energies for electron and proton attachments, adiabatic ionization potentials (IPad) and electron affinities (EAad), adiabatic electronegativities (Xad), dipole moments, electrostatic potentials and spin-density surfaces. EAad data and results of energy-partitioning analysis suggest that the one-electron Q to Q.- reducibility of VI is diminished when compared to that of I. The data also predict that reduction to QH., QH- and QH2 is more favorable in VI (cf. I). Deprotonation enthalpy/energy calculations predict that the oxidizability of the reduced forms of VI is diminished when compared to I. Overall, the calculations suggest that the redox cycling of VI should be diminished if deprotonation is the first step of the autoxidation of the reduced forms. The results suggest that the electron affinity of Q and deprotonation of the reduced forms (e.g., QH.) may play important roles in the redox cycling of the anthracyclines. It is further suggested that these same factors are probably responsible for the reduced toxicity of 5-iminodaunomycin, which consists of VI as part of its pharmacophore. A comparison of the AM1 results with ab initio results suggests that the AM1 method is capable of predicting trends in redox capacity, nucleophilicity, electrophilicity and electron affinity in the systems investigated.},

	Abstract = {Intracellular reduction and oxidation pathways regulate protein functionality through both reversible and irreversible mechanisms. The Cdc25 phosphatases, which control cell cycle progression, are potential subjects of oxidative regulation. Many of the more potent Cdc25 phosphatase inhibitors reported to date are quinones, which are capable of redox cycling. Therefore, we used the previously characterized quinolinedione Cdc25 inhibitor DA3003-1 [NSC 663284 or 6-chloro-7-(2-morpholin-4-yl-ethylamino)-quinoline-5,8-dione] and a newly synthesized congener JUN1111 [7-(2-morpholin-4-yl-ethylamino)-quinoline-5,8-dione] to test the hypothesis that quinone inhibitors of Cdc25 regulate phosphatase activity through redox mechanisms. Like DA3003-1, JUN1111 selectively inhibited Cdc25 phosphatases in vitro in an irreversible, time-dependent manner and arrested cells in the G1 and G2/M phases of the cell cycle. It is noteworthy that both DA3003-1 and JUN1111 directly inhibited Cdc25B activity in cells. Depletion of glutathione increased cellular sensitivity to DA3003-1 and JUN1111, and in vitro Cdc25B inhibition by these compounds was sensitive to pH, catalase, and reductants (dithiothreitol and glutathione), consistent with oxidative inactivation. In addition, both DA3003-1 and JUN1111 rapidly generated intracellular reactive oxygen species. Analysis of Cdc25B by mass spectrometry revealed sulfonic acid formation on the catalytic cysteine of Cdc25B after in vitro treatment with DA3003-1. These results indicate that irreversible oxidation of the catalytic cysteine of Cdc25B is indeed a mechanism by which these quinolinediones inactivate this protein phosphatase.},

@article{Schmitt:2000aa,
	Abstract = {Proliferation toxicity toward the algae Scenedesmus vacuolatus in a 24 h one-generation reproduction assay was determined for nitrobenzene and 18 derivatives, including two phenols. The resultant EC(50) values covering more than 4 orders of magnitude were subjected to a quantitative structure-activity analysis (QSAR) using hydrophobicity in terms of the octanol/water partition coefficient in logarithmic form, log K(ow), and 16 quantum chemical descriptors of molecular reactivity that were calculated with the AM1 scheme. For 13 mononitro derivatives and the highly hydrophobic trifluralin, a narcotic-type mode of action can explain most of the toxicity variation. Correction of log K(ow) for ionization for the phenols and quantification of the molecular susceptibility for one-electron reduction as apparently rate-determining biotransformation step by the energy of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital, E(LUMO), yields a highly significant QSAR for all 19 compounds (r(adj)(2) = 0.90), which can be further improved when adding the maximum net atomic charge at the nitro nitrogen, q(nitro)(-)(N), as the third descriptor (r(adj)(2) = 0.93). Comparison of the energy of the singly occupied molecular orbital, E(SOMO), of the radical anions as initial metabolites with the E(SOMO) of known redox cyclers suggests that dinitrobenzenes and TFM as well as multiply chlorinated nitrobenzenes may also exert oxidative stress. This is based on an E(SOMO) window of -0.30 to 0. 55 eV as a tentative criterion for molecular structures to have the potential for redox cycling, derived from a set of eight known redox cyclers. The discussion includes a detailed analysis of apparently relevant metabolic pathways and associated modes of toxic action of nitroaromatics.},

	Abstract = {Quinone metabolites perform a variety of key functions in plants, including pathogen protection, oxidative phosphorylation, and redox signaling. Many of these structurally diverse compounds have been shown to exhibit potent antimicrobial, anticancer, and anti-inflammatory properties, although the exact mechanisms of action are far from understood. Redox cycling has been proposed as a possible mechanism of action for many quinone species. Experimental determination of the essential thermodynamic data (i.e. electrochemical and pKa values) required to predict the propensity towards redox cycling is often difficult or impossible to obtain due to experimental limitations. We demonstrate a practical computational approach to obtain reasonable estimates of these parameters.},

	Abstract = {Most cellular processes are carried out by multiprotein complexes. The identification and analysis of their components provides insight into how the ensemble of expressed proteins (proteome) is organized into functional units. We used tandem-affinity purification (TAP) and mass spectrometry in a large-scale approach to characterize multiprotein complexes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We processed 1,739 genes, including 1,143 human orthologues of relevance to human biology, and purified 589 protein assemblies. Bioinformatic analysis of these assemblies defined 232 distinct multiprotein complexes and proposed new cellular roles for 344 proteins, including 231 proteins with no previous functional annotation. Comparison of yeast and human complexes showed that conservation across species extends from single proteins to their molecular environment. Our analysis provides an outline of the eukaryotic proteome as a network of protein complexes at a level of organization beyond binary interactions. This higher-order map contains fundamental biological information and offers the context for a more reasoned and informed approach to drug discovery.},

So vast, in fact, that so far only a tiny fraction of it has been explored. Nevertheless, these explorations have greatly enhanced our understanding of biology, and have led to the development of many of today's drugs. The discovery of new bioactive molecules, facilitated by a deeper understanding of the nature of the regions of chemical space that are relevant to biology, will advance our knowledge of biological processes and lead to new strategies to treat disease.},

	Abstract = {The identification of small molecules that fall within the biologically relevant subfraction of vast chemical space is of utmost importance to chemical biology and medicinal chemistry research. The prerequirement of biological relevance to be met by such molecules is fulfilled by natural product-derived compound collections. We report a structural classification of natural products (SCONP) as organizing principle for charting the known chemical space explored by nature. SCONP arranges the scaffolds of the natural products in a tree-like fashion and provides a viable analysis- and hypothesis-generating tool for the design of natural product-derived compound collections. The validity of the approach is demonstrated in the development of a previously undescribed class of selective and potent inhibitors of 11beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 with activity in cells guided by SCONP and protein structure similarity clustering. 11beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 is a target in the development of new therapies for the treatment of diabetes, the metabolic syndrome, and obesity.},

Estimations of possible numbers of unique molecules range from 10(13) to 10(180). These numbers have to be compared with the few tens of millions of compounds currently known. Design of libraries that populate the medicinally relevant chemical subspace and tools that help to maximise the chance of identifying leads are necessary. This review describes various molecular representations that lead to the definition of chemical space, drug space or activity space. Strategies for compound selection in such spaces are discussed, as well as potential sources of diversity that could be used to explore the medicinal space in quest of new drugs.},

	Abstract = {We present the global mapping of pharmacological space by the integration of several vast sources of medicinal chemistry structure-activity relationships (SAR) data. Our comprehensive mapping of pharmacological space enables us to identify confidently the human targets for which chemical tools and drugs have been discovered to date. The integration of SAR data from diverse sources by unique canonical chemical structure, protein sequence and disease indication enables the construction of a ligand-target matrix to explore the global relationships between chemical structure and biological targets. Using the data matrix, we are able to catalog the links between proteins in chemical space as a polypharmacology interaction network. We demonstrate that probabilistic models can be used to predict pharmacology from a large knowledge base. The relationships between proteins, chemical structures and drug-like properties provide a framework for developing a probabilistic approach to drug discovery that can be exploited to increase research productivity.},

	Abstract = {All molecules of up to 11 atoms of C, N, O, and F possible under consideration of simple valency, chemical stability, and synthetic feasibility rules were generated and collected in a database (GDB). GDB contains 26.4 million molecules (110.9 million stereoisomers), including three- and four-membered rings and triple bonds. By comparison, only 63 857 compounds of up to 11 atoms were found in public databases (a combination of PubChem, ChemACX, ChemSCX, NCI open database, and the Merck Index). A total of 538 of the 1208 ring systems in GDB are currently unknown in the CAS Registry and Beilstein databases in any carbon/heteroatom/multiple-bond combination or as a substructure. Over 70% of GDB molecules are chiral. Because of their small size, all compounds obey Lipinski's bioavailability rule. A total of 13.2 million compounds also follow Congreve's "Rule of 3" for lead-likeness. A Kohonen map trained with autocorrelation descriptors organizes GDB according to compound classes and shows that leadlike compounds are most abundant in chiral regions of fused carbocycles and fused heterocycles. The projection of known compounds into this map indicates large uncharted areas of chemical space. The potential of GDB for drug discovery is illustrated by virtual screening for kinase inhibitors, G-protein coupled receptor ligands, and ion-channel modulators. The database is available from the author's Web page.},

	Abstract = {Natural compounds are evolutionary selected and prevalidated by Nature, displaying a unique chemical diversity and a corresponding diversity of biological activities. These features make them highly interesting for studies of chemical biology, and in the pharmaceutical industry for development of new leads. Of utmost importance, for the discovery of new biologically active compounds, is the identification and charting of the corresponding biologically relevant chemical space. The primary key to this is the coverage of the natural products' chemical space. Here we introduce ChemGPS-NP, a new tool tuned for handling the chemical diversity encountered in natural products research, in contrast to previous tools focused on the much more restricted drug-like chemical space. The aim is to provide a framework for making compound classification and comparison more efficient and stringent, to identify volumes of chemical space related to particular biological activities, and to track changes in chemical properties due to, for example, evolutionary traits and modifications in biosynthesis. Physical-chemical properties not directly discernible from structural data can be discovered, making selection more efficient and increasing the probability of hit generation when screening natural compounds and analogues.},

	Abstract = {Preclinical Safety Pharmacology (PSP) attempts to anticipate adverse drug reactions (ADRs) during early phases of drug discovery by testing compounds in simple, in vitro binding assays (that is, preclinical profiling). The selection of PSP targets is based largely on circumstantial evidence of their contribution to known clinical ADRs, inferred from findings in clinical trials, animal experiments, and molecular studies going back more than forty years. In this work we explore PSP chemical space and its relevance for the prediction of adverse drug reactions. Firstly, in silico (computational) Bayesian models for 70 PSP-related targets were built, which are able to detect 93 % of the ligands binding at IC(50)</=10 muM at an overall correct classification rate of about 94 %. Secondly, employing the World Drug Index (WDI), a model for adverse drug reactions was built directly based on normalized side-effect annotations in the WDI, which does not require any underlying functional knowledge. This is, to our knowledge, the first attempt to predict adverse drug reactions across hundreds of categories from chemical structure alone. On average 90 % of the adverse drug reactions observed with known, clinically used compounds were detected, an overall correct classification rate of 92 %. Drugs withdrawn from the market (Rapacuronium, Suprofen) were tested in the model and their predicted ADRs align well with known ADRs. The analysis was repeated for acetylsalicylic acid and Benperidol which are still on the market. Importantly, features of the models are interpretable and back-projectable to chemical structure, raising the possibility of rationally engineering out adverse effects. By combining PSP and ADR models new hypotheses linking targets and adverse effects can be proposed and examples for the opioid mu and the muscarinic M2 receptors, as well as for cyclooxygenase-1 are presented. It is hoped that the generation of predictive models for adverse drug reactions is able to help support early SAR to accelerate drug discovery and decrease late stage attrition in drug discovery projects. In addition, models such as the ones presented here can be used for compound profiling in all development stages.},

	Abstract = {Combinatorial chemistry needs focused molecular diversity applied to the druglike chemical space (drugspace). A drugspace map can be obtained by systematically applying the same conventions when examining the chemical space, in a manner similar to the Mercator convention in geography: Rules are equivalent to dimensions (e.g., longitude and latitude), while structures are equivalent to objects (e.g., cities and countries). Selected rules include size, lipophilicity, polarizability, charge, flexibility, rigidity, and hydrogen bond capacity. For these, extreme values were set, e.g., maximum molecular weight 1500, calculated negative logarithm of the octanol/water partition between -10 and 20, and up to 30 nonterminal rotatable bonds. Only S, N, O, P, and halogens were considered as elements besides C and H. Selected objects include a set of "satellite" structures and a set of representative drugs ("core" structures). Satellites, intentionally placed outside drugspace, have extreme values in one or several of the desired properties, while containing druglike chemical fragments. ChemGPS (chemical global positioning system) is a tool that combines these predefined rules and objects to provide a global drugspace map. The ChemGPS drugspace map coordinates are t-scores extracted via principal component analysis (PCA) from 72 descriptors that evaluate the above-mentioned rules on a total set of 423 satellite and core structures. Global ChemGPS scores describe well the latent structures extracted with PCA for a set of 8599 monocarboxylates, a set of 45 heteroaromatic compounds, and for 87 alpha-amino acids. ChemGPS positions novel structures in drugspace via PCA-score prediction, providing a unique mapping device for the druglike chemical space. ChemGPS scores are comparable across a large number of chemicals and do not change as new structures are predicted, making this tool a well-suited reference system for comparing multiple libraries and for keeping track of previously explored regions of the chemical space.},

	Abstract = {ChemGPS, the chemical global positioning system, is a tool that combines rules (equivalent to dimensions) and objects (chemical structures) to provide a consistent chemical space map (Oprea, T. I.; Gottfries, J. J. Comb. Chem. 2001, 3, 157-166.). Rules included, initially, general properties such as size, lipophilicity, and hydrogen bond capacity, while objects include "satellites", intentionally placed outside the druglike space, as well as "core" objects, mostly orally available drugs. ChemGPS molecules (objects) were used in conjunction with the VolSurf (http://www.moldiscovery.com) descriptors (rules), which are relevant for ADME (absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion) properties. The combination of ChemGPS and VolSurf, GPSVS, was investigated with respect to the biopharmaceutics classification system, which is recommended by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) (http://www.fda.gov/cder/OPS/BCS_guidance.htm), in particular with respect to permeability and solubility. The first GPSVS principal component correlates, with no further training, to passive transcellular permeability, as illustrated for the Caco-2, ghost erythrocyte, and blood-brain barrier datasets, respectively. The second GPSVS principal component correlates, without prior training, to solubility, as shown for the octanol-water partition and intrinsic solubility datasets, respectively. Although derived from principal component analysis, the two property axes rotate and form an angle of approximately 43 degrees, thus being no longer orthogonal. GPSVS can be used to map the chemical space with respect to permeability and solubility, as recommended by FDA's biopharmaceutics classification system.},

	Abstract = {We present a methodology for solving the inverse-quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) problem using the molecular descriptor called signature. This methodology is detailed in four parts. First, we create a QSAR equation that correlates the occurrence of a signature to the activity values using a stepwise multilinear regression technique. Second, we construct constraint equations, specifically the graphicality and consistency equations, which facilitate the reconstruction of the solution compounds directly from the signatures. Third, we solve the set of constraint equations, which are both linear and Diophantine in nature. Last, we reconstruct and enumerate the solution molecules and calculate their activity values from the QSAR equation. We apply this inverse-QSAR method to a small set of LFA-1/ICAM-1 peptide inhibitors to assist in the search and design of more-potent inhibitory compounds. Many novel inhibitors were predicted, a number of which are predicted to be more potent than the strongest inhibitor in the training set. Two of the more potent inhibitors were synthesized and tested in-vivo, confirming them to be the strongest inhibiting peptides to date. Some of these compounds can be recycled to train a new QSAR and develop a more focused library of lead compounds.},

These compounds show up as hits in many different biological assays covering a wide range of targets. A scoring scheme was elaborated from substructure analysis, multivariate linear and nonlinear statistical methods applied to several sets of one and two-dimensional molecular descriptors. The final model is based on a three-layered neural network, yielding a predictive Matthews correlation coefficient of 0.81. This system was able to correctly classify 90% of the test set molecules in a 10-times cross-validation study. The method was applied to database filtering, yielding between 8% (compilation of trade drugs) and 35% (Available Chemicals Directory) potential frequent hitters. This filter will be a valuable tool for the prioritization of compounds from large databases, for compound purchase and biological testing, and for building new virtual libraries.},

	Abstract = {At micromolar concentrations, many small molecules self-associate into colloidal aggregates that non-specifically inhibit enzymes and other proteins. Here we describe a protocol for identifying aggregate-based inhibitors and distinguishing them from small molecules that inhibit via specific mechanisms. As a convenient proxy for promiscuous, aggregate-based inhibition, we monitor inhibition of beta-lactamase in the absence and presence of detergent. Inhibition that is attenuated in the presence of detergent is characteristic of an aggregate-based mechanism. In the 96-well-format assay described here, about 200 molecules can be tested, in duplicate, per hour for detergent-dependent sensitivity. Furthermore, we also describe simple experiments that can offer additional confirmation of aggregate-based inhibition.},

	Abstract = {High-throughput screening (HTS) searches large libraries of chemical compounds for those that can modulate the activity of a particular biological target; it is the dominant technique used in early-stage drug discovery. A key problem in HTS is the prevalence of nonspecific or 'promiscuous' inhibitors. These molecules have peculiar properties, act on unrelated targets and can dominate the results from screening campaigns. Several explanations have been proposed to account for promiscuous inhibitors, including chemical reactivity, interference in assay read-out, high molecular flexibility and hydrophobicity. The diversity of these models reflects the apparently unrelated molecules whose behaviors they seek to explain. However, a single mechanism may explain the effects of many promiscuous inhibitors: some organic molecules form large colloid-like aggregates that sequester and thereby inhibit enzymes. Hits from HTS, leads for drug discovery and even several drugs appear to act through this mechanism at micromolar concentrations. Here, we report two rapid assays for detecting promiscuous aggregates that we tested against 1,030 'drug-like' molecules. The results from these assays were used to test two preliminary computational models of this phenomenon and as benchmarks to develop new models.},

Three models might explain these curves: multisite binding, an inhibitor phase transition, or stoichiometric inhibition caused by a high enzyme to Kd ratio. Experiments with promiscuous aggregators, for which steep curves are common, suggest that these curves owe to stoichiometric inhibition, which predicts that IC50 should vary linearly with enzyme concentration. Most steep dose-response curves in screening may be due to this effect.},

Here we investigate how the "compound load" of mixtures influences promiscuous aggregate-based inhibition. We screened 764 molecules individually and in mixtures of 10 at 5 miccroM each, comparing the observed inhibition of the mixtures to that predicted from single-compound results. Synergistic effects on aggregation predominated, although antagonism was also observed. These results suggest that screening mixtures can increase aggregation-based inhibition in a nonadditive manner.},

	Abstract = {C-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) is a therapeutic target for inhibitors which may provide clinical benefit in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) as well as in various apoptosis-related disorders. The benzothiazol-2-yl acetonitrile derivatives, recently reported by Pascale et al. (J.~Med.~Chem. 2005, 48, 4596-4607), are the first generation JNK inhibitors of this class. To understand inhibitory mechanisms and elucidate pharmacophoric properties of these derivatives molecular docking and 3D-QSAR studies were performed on a set of 44 compounds. Ligand Fit module of Cerius2 (4.9) was employed to locate the binding orientations of all the compounds within the JNK-3 ATP binding site. A good correlation (r2=0.810) between the calculated binding free energies (-PMF score) and the experimental inhibitory activities suggests that the identified binding conformations of these potential inhibitors are reliable. Based on the binding conformations, robust and highly predictive 3D-QSAR models were developed with conventional r2 0.886 and 0.802, full cross-validation r2 0.980 and 0.788, and predictive r2 0.965 and 0.968 for MFA and MSA, respectively. The interaction mode was demonstrated taking into consideration inhibitor conformation, hydrogen bonding, and electrostatic interaction. The 3D-QSAR model built in this study will provide clear guidelines for a novel inhibitor design based on the benzothiazole derivatives against JNK-3 for the treatment of inflammatory disorders.},

	Abstract = {Anilinopyrazoles as CDK2 inhibitors can adopt multiple binding modes depending on the substituents at the 5-position of the pyrazole ring, based on CDK2/cyclin A crystallographic studies. Three commercially available docking programs, FlexX, GOLD, and LigandFit, were tested with 63 anilinopyrazole analogues in an attempt to reproduce the binding modes observed in the crystal structures. Each docking program gave different ligand conformations depending on the scoring or energy functions used. FlexX/drugscore, GOLD/chemscore, and LigandFit/plp were the best combinations of each docking program in reproducing the ligand conformations observed in the crystal structures. The 63 analogues were divided into two groups, type-A and type-B, depending on the substituent at the 5-position of the pyrazole ring. Although an alternate binding mode, observed in a crystal structure of one type-B compound, could not be reproduced with any of the above docking/scoring combinations, GOLD, with a template constraint based on the crystal structure coordinates, was able to reproduce the pose. As for type-A compounds, all docking conditions yielded similar poses to those observed in crystal structures. When predicting activities by scoring programs, the combination of docking with LigandFit/plp and scoring with LIGSCORE1_CFF gave the best correlation coefficient (r=0.60) between experimental pIC50 values and top-ranked rescores of 30 poses of each compound. With regard to type-A compounds, the correlation was 0.69. However, when 11 compounds, whose top-ranked rescored poses did not demonstrate the correct binding modes in reference to the crystal structure, were removed, the correlation rose to 0.75. Consequently, predicting activity on the basis of correct binding modes was found to be reliable.},

	Abstract = {A series of 39 (a training set of 29 and a test set of 10) interphenylene 7-oxabicyclo [2.2.1]heptane oxazole thromboxane A2 (TXA2) receptor antagonists were studied using four-dimensional quantitative structure-activity relationship (4D-QSAR) analysis. Two thousand conformations of each analogue were sampled to generate a conformational energy profile (CEP) from a molecular dynamic simulation (MDS) of 100,000 trajectory states. Each conformation was placed in a grid cell lattice for each of six trial alignments. Cubic grid cell sizes of 1 and 2 A were considered. The frequency of occupation of each grid cell was computed for each of seven types of pharmacophoric group classes of atoms of each compound. These grid cell occupancy descriptors (GCODs) were then used as independent variables in constructing three-dimensional (3D)-QSAR models after data reduction. The types of data reduction included doing no reducing, reduction based on individual GCOD correlation with activity, and reduction from minimum variance constraints over the GCOD population. The 3D-QSAR models were generated and evaluated by a scheme that combines a genetic algorithm (GA) optimization with partial least squares (PLS) regression. The 3D-QSAR models were evaluated by cross-validation using the leave-one-out technique. The cross-validated correlation coefficient, Q2, ranged from 0.27 to 0.86. The models are not from chance correlation because a scrambled data set was generated and evaluated (Q2 = 0.25-0.37). A composite 3D-QSAR model was constructed using the best models derived from GCODs of both 1 and 2 A grid cell size lattices. The 3D-QSAR models provide detailed 3D pharmacophore requirements in terms of atom types and corresponding locations needed for high TXA2 inhibition activity. Specific sites in space that should not be occupied by an active inhibitor are also specified. The GCOD measures for the compounds in the training set permit reference points regarding which pharmacophore sites can provide the largest boosts in inhibition activity relative to the existing analogues.},

	Abstract = {A set of 47 glucose analogue inhibitors of glycogen phosphorylase was investigated using 4D-QSAR analysis. A single significant 4D-QSAR model, having no outliers, was found as a function of alignment and conformational sampling. This 4D-QSAR model consists of six grid cell occupancy descriptors which defines the thermodynamic averaged spatial pharmacophore for this set of analogues. The 4D-QSAR model was validated by aligning it upon the crystal structures of glycogen phosphorylase with some bound inhibitors of the training set. Validation of the 4D-QSAR model was realized by establishing the consistency of the types and locations of the grid cell occupancy descriptors relative to the binding interaction sites of the crystal complex. The loss in binding free energy, due to loss in inhibitor conformational entropy upon binding to the enzyme, was computed and found to be in the 0-2 kcal/mol range for these inhibitors. The "active" conformation of each analogue was also postulated from the 4D-QSAR model.

	Abstract = {Quantitative Structure-Selectivity Relationships (QSSR) are developed for a library of 40 phase-transfer asymmetric catalysts, based around quaternary ammonium salts, using Comparative Molecular Field Analysis (CoMFA) and closely related variants. Due to the flexibility of these catalysts, we use molecular dynamics (MD) with an implicit Generalized Born solvent model to explore their conformational space. Comparison with crystal data indicates that relevant conformations are obtained and that, furthermore, the correct biphenyl twist conformation is predicted, as illustrated by the superiority of the resulting model (leave-one-out q(2) = 0.78) compared to a random choice of low-energy conformations for each catalyst (average q(2) = 0.22). We extend this model by incorporating the MD trajectory directly into a 4D QSSR and by Boltzmann-weighting the contribution of selected minimized conformations, which we refer to as '3.5D' QSSR. The latter method improves on the predictive ability of the 3D QSSR (leave-one-out q(2) = 0.83), as confirmed by repeated training/test splits.},

	Abstract = {Shape Signatures, a new 3-dimensional molecular comparison method, has been adapted to rank ligands of the serotonin receptors. A set of 825 agonists and 400 antagonists together with approximately 10,000 randomly chosen compounds from the NCI database were used in this study. Both 1D and 2D Shape Signature databases were created, and enrichment studies were carried out. Results from these studies reveal that the 1D Shape Signature approach is highly efficient in separating agonists from a mixture of molecules which includes compounds randomly selected from the NCI database taken as inactives. It is also equally effective at separating agonists and antagonists from a pool of active ligands for the serotonin receptor. Parallel enrichment studies using 2D shape signatures showed high selectivity with more restricted coverage due to the high specificity of 2D signatures. The influence of conformational variation of the shape signature on enrichment was explored by docking a subset of ligands into the crystal structure of serotonin N-acetyltransferase. Enrichment studies on the resulting "docked" conformations produced only slightly improved results compared with the CORINA-generated conformations.},

@article{Inglese:2006fk,
	Abstract = {High-throughput screening (HTS) of chemical compounds to identify modulators of molecular targets is a mainstay of pharmaceutical development. Increasingly, HTS is being used to identify chemical probes of gene, pathway, and cell functions, with the ultimate goal of comprehensively delineating relationships between chemical structures and biological activities. Achieving this goal will require methodologies that efficiently generate pharmacological data from the primary screen and reliably profile the range of biological activities associated with large chemical libraries. Traditional HTS, which tests compounds at a single concentration, is not suited to this task, because HTS is burdened by frequent false positives and false negatives and requires extensive follow-up testing. We have developed a paradigm, quantitative HTS (qHTS), tested with the enzyme pyruvate kinase, to generate concentration-response curves for >60,000 compounds in a single experiment. We show that this method is precise, refractory to variations in sample preparation, and identifies compounds with a wide range of activities. Concentration-response curves were classified to rapidly identify pyruvate kinase activators and inhibitors with a variety of potencies and efficacies and elucidate structure-activity relationships directly from the primary screen. Comparison of qHTS with traditional single-concentration HTS revealed a high prevalence of false negatives in the single-point screen. This study demonstrates the feasibility of qHTS for accurately profiling every compound in large chemical libraries (>10(5) compounds). qHTS produces rich data sets that can be immediately mined for reliable biological activities, thereby providing a platform for chemical genomics and accelerating the identification of leads for drug discovery.},

	Abstract = {High-throughput screening (HTS) is the primary technique for new lead identification in drug discovery and chemical biology. Unfortunately, it is susceptible to false-positive hits. One common mechanism for such false-positives is the congregation of organic molecules into colloidal aggregates, which nonspecifically inhibit enzymes. To both evaluate the feasibility of large-scale identification of aggregate-based inhibition and quantify its prevalence among screening hits, we tested 70 563 molecules from the National Institutes of Health Chemical Genomics Center (NCGC) library for detergent-sensitive inhibition. Each molecule was screened in at least seven concentrations, such that dose-response curves were obtained for all molecules in the library. There were 1274 inhibitors identified in total, of which 1204 were unambiguously detergent-sensitive. We identified these as aggregate-based inhibitors. Thirty-one library molecules were independently purchased and retested in secondary low-throughput experiments; 29 of these were confirmed as either aggregators or nonaggregators, as appropriate. Finally, with the dose-response information collected for every compound, we could examine the correlation between aggregate-based inhibition and steep dose-response curves. Three key results emerge from this study: first, detergent-dependent identification of aggregate-based inhibition is feasible on the large scale. Second, 95% of the actives obtained in this screen are aggregate-based inhibitors. Third, aggregate-based inhibition is correlated with steep dose-response curves, although not absolutely. The results of this screen are being released publicly via the PubChem database.},

	Abstract = {A method is introduced that allows one to select, for a given property and compound, among several prediction methods the presumably best-performing scheme based on prediction errors evaluated for structurally similar compounds. The latter are selected through analysis of atom-centered fragments (ACFs) in accord with a k nearest neighbor procedure in the two-dimensional structural space. The approach is illustrated with seven estimation methods for the water solubility of organic compounds and a reference set of 1876 compounds with validated experimental values. The discussion includes a comparison with the similarity-based error correction as an alternative approach to improve the performance of prediction methods and an extension that enables an ad hoc specification of the application domain.},

	Abstract = {A natural product collection and natural-product-derived combinatorial libraries were virtually screened for potential inhibitors of human 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO) activity. We followed a sequential ligand-based approach in two steps. First, similarity searching with a topological pharmacophore descriptor (CATS 2D method) was performed to enable scaffold-hopping. Eighteen compounds were selected from a virtual hit list of 430 substances, which had mutual pharmacophore features with at least one of 43 known 5-LO inhibitors that served as query structures. Two new chemotypes exhibited significant activity in a cell-based 5-LO activity assay. The two most potent molecules served as seed structures for a second virtual screening round. This time, a focused natural-product-derived combinatorial library was analyzed by different ligand-based virtual screening methods. The best molecules from the final set of screening candidates potently suppressed 5-LO activity in intact cells and may represent a novel class of 5-LO inhibitors. The results demonstrate the potential of natural-product-derived screening libraries for hit and lead structure identification.},

	Abstract = {We discussed three dissimilarity measures between dendrograms defined over the same set, they are triples, partition, and cluster indices. All of them decompose the dendrograms into subsets. In the case of triples and partition indices, these subsets correspond to binary partitions containing some clusters, while in the cluster index, a novel dissimilarity method introduced in this paper, the subsets are exclusively clusters. In chemical applications, the dendrograms gather clusters that contain similarity information of the data set under study. Thereby, the cluster index is the most suitable dissimilarity measure between dendrograms resulting from chemical investigation. An application example of the three measures is shown to remark upon the advantages of the cluster index over the other two methods in similarity studies. Finally, the cluster index is used to measure the differences between five dendrograms obtained when applying five common hierarchical clustering algorithms on a database of 1000 molecules.},

@article{Crisman:2007lr,
	Abstract = {This work describes a novel semi-sequential technique for in silico enhancement of high-throughput screening (HTS) experiments now employed at Novartis. It is used in situations in which the size of the screen is limited by the readout (e.g., high-content screens) or the amount of reagents or tools (proteins or cells) available. By performing computational chemical diversity selection on a per plate basis (instead of a per compound basis), 25% of the 1,000,000-compound screening was optimized for general initial HTS. Statistical models are then generated from target-specific primary results (percentage inhibition data) to drive the cherry picking and testing from the entire collection. Using retrospective analysis of 11 HTS campaigns, the authors show that this method would have captured on average two thirds of the active compounds (IC(50) < 10 microM) and three fourths of the active Murcko scaffolds while decreasing screening expenditure by nearly 75%. This result is true for a wide variety of targets, including G-protein-coupled receptors, chemokine receptors, kinases, metalloproteinases, pathway screens, and protein-protein interactions. Unlike time-consuming "classic" sequential approaches that require multiple iterations of cherry picking, testing, and building statistical models, here individual compounds are cherry picked just once, based directly on primary screening data. Strikingly, the authors demonstrate that models built from primary data are as robust as models built from IC(50) data. This is true for all HTS campaigns analyzed, which represent a wide variety of target classes and assay types.},

	Abstract = { We describe a novel diversity metric for use in the design of combinatorial
	chemistry and high-throughput screening experiments. The method estimates
	the cumulative probability distribution of intermolecular dissimilarities
	in the collection of interest and then measures the deviation of
	that distribution from the respective distribution of a uniform sample
	using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic. The distinct advantage of
	this approach is that the cumulative distribution can be easily estimated
	using probability sampling and does not require exhaustive enumeration
	of all pairwise distances in the data set. The function is intuitive,
	very fast to compute, does not depend on the size of the collection,
	and can be used to perform diversity estimates on both global and
	local scale. More importantly, it allows meaningful comparison of
	data sets of different cardinality and is not affected by the curse
	of dimensionality, which plagues many other diversity indices. The
	advantages of this approach are demonstrated using examples from
	the combinatorial chemistry literature. },

	Abstract = { The problem of quantifying molecular diversity continues to attract
	significant interest among computational chemists. Most algorithms
	reported to date are distance-based and scale to the square of the
	size of the data set. This paper reports an alternative algorithm
	based on k-dimensional (or k-d) trees. k-d trees are combinatorial
	data structures that allow expedient location of nearest neighbors
	in multivariate spaces. Nearest neighbor detection forms the basis
	of many popular diversity measures, such as maximin, minimum spanning
	trees, and many others. In this report, we demonstrate that k-d trees
	exhibit excellent scaling characteristics and can be used to accelerate
	diversity estimation without compromising the quality of the design.
	The advantages of this approach are contrasted with an alternative
	algorithm that was recently proposed by Turner et al. based on the
	cosine similarity coefficient. },

	Abstract = {Some time ago a structure-descriptor, named "chirality code", was
	put forward [J.~Chem.~Inf.~Comput.~Sci. 2001, 41, 369-375], aimed
	at distinguishing between enantiomers. The chirality code is a sequence
	of (typically 100) numbers, being equal to the value of a certain
	"chirality function" at equidistant points within a chosen interval.
	For molecules of moderate size the chirality function has thousands
	of peaks (maxima and minima), one for each quartet of atoms. Therefore
	it looks as if the chirality code cannot provide a faithful representation
	of the chirality function and thus a faithful representation of the
	molecular structure. We now show that functional groups present in
	the molecule result in clusters of near-lying and partially overlapping
	peaks, whose position in the chirality code is characteristic for
	the particular functional group. This enables a sound structural
	interpretation of the chirality code.},

@article{Ajmani:2006rr,
	Abstract = { In this paper we report a novel three-dimensional QSAR approach,
	kNN-MFA, developed based on principles of the k-nearest neighbor
	method combined with various variable selection procedures. The kNN-MFA
	approach was used to generate models for three different data sets
	and predict the activity of test molecules through each of these
	models. The three data sets used were the standard steroid benchmark,
	an antiinflammatory and an anticancerous data set. The study resulted
	in kNN-MFA models having better statistical parameters than the reported
	CoMFA models for all the three data sets. It was also found that
	stochastic methods generate better models resulting in more accurate
	predictions as compared to stepwise forward selection procedures.
	Thus, kNN-MFA method represents a good alternative to CoMFA-like
	methods. },

	Abstract = {Abstract: Water molecules play a crucial role in mediating the interaction
	between a ligand and a macromolecular receptor. An understanding
	of the nature and role of each water molecule in the active site
	of a protein could greatly increase the efficiency of rational drug
	design approaches: if the propensity of a water molecule for displacement
	can be determined, then synthetic effort may be most profitably applied
	to the design of specific ligands with the displacement of this water
	molecule in mind. In this paper, a thermodynamic analysis of water
	molecules in the binding sites of six proteins, each complexed with
	a number of inhibitors, is presented. Two classes of water molecules
	were identified: those conserved and not displaced by any of the
	ligands, and those that are displaced by some ligands. The absolute
	binding free energies of 54 water molecules were calculated using
	the double decoupling method, with replica exchange thermodynamic
	integration in Monte Carlo simulations. It was found that conserved
	water molecules are on average more tightly bound than displaced
	water molecules. In addition, Bayesian statistics is used to calculate
	the probability that a particular water molecule may be displaced
	by an appropriately designed ligand, given the calculated binding
	free energy of the water molecule. This approach therefore allows
	the numerical assessment of whether or not a given water molecule
	should be targeted for displacement as part of a rational drug design
	strategy.},

	Abstract = {We have performed virtual screening using some very simple features,
	by employing the number of atoms per element as molecular descriptors
	but without regard to any structural information whatsoever. Surprisingly,
	these atom counts are able to outperform virtual-affinity-based fingerprints
	and Unity fingerprints in some activity classes. Although molecular
	weight and other biases were known in target-based virtual screening
	settings (docking), we report the effect of using very simple descriptors
	for ligand-based virtual screening, by using clearly defined biological
	targets and employing a large data set (>100,000 compounds) containing
	multiple (11) activity classes. Structure-unaware atom count vectors
	as descriptors in combination with the Euclidean distance measure
	are able to achieve "enrichment factors" over random selection of
	around 4 (depending on the particular class of active compounds),
	putting the enrichment factors reported for more sophisticated virtual
	screening methods in a different light. They are also able to retrieve
	active compounds with novel scaffolds instead of merely the expected
	structural analogues. The added value of many currently used virtual
	screening methods (calculated as enrichment factors) drops down to
	a factor of between 1 and 2, instead of often reported double-digit
	figures. The observed effect is much less profound for simple descriptors
	such as molecular weight and is only present in cases of atypical
	(larger) ligands. The current state of virtual screening is not as
	sophisticated as might be expected, which is due to descriptors still
	not being able to capture structural properties relevant to binding.
	This fact can partly be explained by highly nonlinear structure-activity
	relationships, which represent a severe limitation of the "similar
	property principle" in the context of bioactivity.},

@article{Bender:2004ab,
	Abstract = {Molecular Informatics utilises many ideas and concepts to find relationships
	between molecules. The concept of similarity, where molecules may
	be grouped according to their biological effects or physicochemical
	properties has found extensive use in drug discovery. Some areas
	of particular interest have been in lead discovery and compound optimisation.
	For example, in designing libraries of compounds for lead generation,
	one approach is to design sets of compounds "similar" to known active
	compounds in the hope that alternative molecular structures are found
	that maintain the properties required while enhancing e.g. patentability,
	medicinal chemistry opportunities or even in achieving optimised
	pharmacokinetic profiles. Thus the practical importance of the concept
	of molecular similarity has grown dramatically in recent years. The
	predominant users are pharmaceutical companies, employing similarity
	methods in a wide range of applications e.g. virtual screening, estimation
	of absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion and toxicity (ADME/Tox)
	and prediction of physicochemical properties (solubility, partitioning
	etc.). In this perspective, we discuss the representation of molecular
	structure (descriptors), methods of comparing structures and how
	these relate to measured properties. This leads to the concept of
	molecular similarity, its various definitions and uses and how these
	have evolved in recent years. Here, we wish to evaluate and in some
	cases challenge accepted views and uses of molecular similarity.
	Molecular similarity, as a paradigm, contains many implicit and explicit
	assumptions in particular with respect to the prediction of the binding
	and efficacy of molecules at biological receptors. The fundamental
	observation is that molecular similarity has a context which both
	defines and limits its use. The key issues of solvation effects,
	heterogeneity of binding sites and the fundamental problem of the
	form of similarity measure to use are addressed.},

@article{Bender:2006aa,
	Abstract = {Conventional similarity searching of molecules compares single (or
	multiple) active query structures to each other in a relative framework,
	by means of a structural descriptor and a similarity measure. While
	this often works well, depending on the target, we show here that
	retrieval rates can be improved considerably by incorporating an
	external framework describing ligand bioactivity space for comparisons
	("Bayes affinity fingerprints"). Structures are described by Bayes
	scores for a ligand panel comprising about 1000 activity classes
	extracted from the WOMBAT database. The comparison of structures
	is performed via the Pearson correlation coefficient of activity
	classes, that is, the order in which two structures are similar to
	the panel activity classes. Compound retrieval on a recently published
	data set could be improved by as much as 24\% relative (9\% absolute).
	Knowledge about the shape of the "bioactive chemical universe" is
	thus beneficial to identifying similar bioactivities. Principal component
	analysis was employed to further analyze activity space with the
	objective to define orthogonal ligand bioactive chemical space, leading
	to nine major (roughly orthogonal) activity axes. Employing only
	those nine activity classes, retrieval rates are still comparable
	to original Bayes affinity fingerprints; thus, the concept of orthogonal
	bioactive ligand chemical space was validated as being an information-rich
	but low-dimensional representation of bioactivity space. Correlations
	between activity classes are a major determinant to gauge whether
	the desired multitarget activity of drugs is (on the basis of current
	knowledge) a feasible concept because it measures the extent to which
	activities can be optimized independently, or only by strongly influencing
	one another.},

	Abstract = { We investigate with the use of theoretical methodologies the activity
	of a set of 41 benzo[c]quinolizin-3-ones (BC3), some of them explored
	as selective inhibitors of the human 5-reductase steroid. For the
	structure-activity study we have considered dividing the molecules
	into groups of tested and nontested compounds. Semiempirical calculations
	and pattern recognition methods such as Electronic Indices Methodology
	(EIM), Principal Components Analysis (PCA), Hierarchical Cluster
	Analysis (HCA), and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) have been applied to
	search for a correlation between experimental activity and theoretical
	descriptors. Our results show that it is possible to directly correlate
	some molecular quantum descriptors with BC3 biological activity.
	This information can be used in principle to identify active/inactive
	untested compounds and/or to design new active compounds. },

	Abstract = {We present a comparative assessment of several state-of-the-art machine
	learning tools for mining drug data, including support vector machines
	(SVMs) and the ensemble decision tree methods boosting, bagging,
	and random forest, using eight data sets and two sets of descriptors.
	We demonstrate, by rigorous multiple comparison statistical tests,
	that these techniques can provide consistent improvements in predictive
	performance over single decision trees. However, within these methods,
	there is no clearly best-performing algorithm. This motivates a more
	in-depth investigation into the properties of random forests. We
	identify a set of parameters for the random forest that provide optimal
	performance across all the studied data sets. Additionally, the tree
	ensemble structure of the forest may provide an interpretable model,
	a considerable advantage over SVMs. We test this possibility and
	compare it with standard decision tree models.},

	Abstract = { Two extensive studies quantifying the ability of topomer shape similarity
	to forecast a variety of biological similarities are described. In
	a prospective trial of "lead hopping", using topomer similarity for
	virtual screening and queries from the patent literature, biological
	assays of 308 selected compounds (representing 0.03\% of those available,
	per assay type) yielded 11 successful "lead hops" in the 13 assays
	attempted. The hit rate averaged over all assays was 39\% ("activity"
	defined as inhibition 20\% at 10 M), significantly greater than an
	unexpectedly high negative control hit rate of 15\%. The average
	"Tanimoto 2D fingerprint similarity" between query and "lead hop"
	structures (0.36) was little more than the Tanimoto similarity between
	random drug-like structures. Topomer shape and Tanimoto 2D fingerprint
	similarities were also compared retrospectively, in their tendencies
	to concentrate together potential and actual drugs reported to belong
	to the same "activity class", for twenty classes. Among the most
	similar 3\% of structures (corresponding to "0.85 Tanimoto" for these
	structures), an average of 62\% of the topomer similar selection
	possessed a near neighbor belonging to the same activity class, roughly
	a one-third superiority over the "Tanimoto 0.85" selection containing
	48\% actives in avoiding false positives. Conversely, the least similar
	75\% of structures contained 0.3\% actives for topomer similarity
	vs 1.0\% actives for Tanimoto 2D fingerprint similarity, a 3-fold
	superiority for topomers in avoiding false negatives. },

	more than 300 000 structures. Topological indices and the free energy
	of solvation were computed for each compound in the databases. Factor
	analysis was used to reduce the dimensionality of the descriptor
	space. Low density observations were deleted as a way of removing
	outliers, which allowed a further reduction in the descriptor space
	of interest. The five databases could then be compared on an efficient
	basis using a metric developed for this purpose. A Riemann gridding
	scheme was used to subdivide the factor space into subhypercubes
	to obtain accurate comparisons. Most of the 300 000 structures were
	highly clustered, but unique structures were found. An analysis of
	overlap between the biological and commercial databases was carried
	out. The metric provides a useful algorithm for choosing screening
	sets of diverse compounds from large databases. },

	Abstract = {Virtual screening (VS) has become a preferred tool to augment high-throughput screening1 and determine new leads in the drug discovery process. The core of a VS informatics pipeline includes several data mining algorithms that work on huge databases of chemical compounds containing millions of molecular structures and their associated data. Thus, scaling traditional applications such as classification, partitioning, and outlier detection for huge chemical data sets without a significant loss in accuracy is very important. In this paper, we introduce a data mining framework built on top of a recently developed fast approximate nearest-neighbor-finding algorithm called locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) that can be used to mine huge chemical spaces in a scalable fashion using very modest computational resources. The core LSH algorithm hashes chemical descriptors so that points close to each other in the descriptor space are also close to each other in the hashed space. Using this data structure, one can perform approximate nearest-neighbor searches very quickly, in sublinear time. We validate the accuracy and performance of our framework on three real data sets of sizes ranging from 4337 to 249,071 molecules. Results indicate that the identification of nearest neighbors using the LSH algorithm is at least 2 orders of magnitude faster than the traditional k-nearest-neighbor method and is over 94% accurate for most query parameters. Furthermore, when viewed as a data-partitioning procedure, the LSH algorithm lends itself to easy parallelization of nearest-neighbor classification or regression. We also apply our framework to detect outlying (diverse) compounds in a given chemical space; this algorithm is extremely rapid in determining whether a compound is located in a sparse region of chemical space or not, and it is quite accurate when compared to results obtained using principal-component-analysis-based heuristics. },

	Abstract = {Molecular polar surface area (PSA), i.e., surface belonging to polar atoms, is a descriptor that was shown to correlate well with passive molecular transport through membranes and, therefore, allows prediction of transport properties of drugs. The calculation of PSA, however, is rather time-consuming because of the necessity to generate a reasonable 3D molecular geometry and the calculation of the surface itself. A new approach for the calculation of the PSA is presented here, based on the summation of tabulated surface contributions of polar fragments. The method, termed topological PSA (TPSA), provides results which are practically identical with the 3D PSA (the correlation coefficient between 3D PSA and fragment-based TPSA for 34 810 molecules from the World Drug Index is 0.99), while the computation speed is 2-3 orders of magnitude faster. The new methodology may, therefore, be used for fast bioavailability screening of virtual libraries having millions of molecules. This article describes the new methodology and shows the results of validation studies based on sets of published absorption data, including intestinal absorption, Caco-2 monolayer penetration, and blood-brain barrier penetration.},

	by leave-one-out cross validation. In addition, for a more rigorous
	measure of the predictive capacity, multiple validation sets were
	randomly generated as members of neural network ensembles, which
	makes doing averaged predictions feasible. In this way, the predictive
	power was analyzed accounting for the averaged test set R values
	and test set mean-square errors. Otherwise, Kohonen self-organizing
	maps were used as an additional tool for the same modeling. The location
	of the inhibitors in a map facilitates the analysis of the connection

	Abstract = {The aim of this work is to present the anchor-GRIND methodology. Anchor-GRIND efficiently combines a priori chemical and biological knowledge about the studied compounds with alignment-independent molecular descriptors derived from molecular interaction fields. Such descriptors are particularly useful for series of ligands sharing a common scaffold but with very diverse substituents. The method uses a specific position of the molecular structure (the "anchor point") to compare the spatial distribution of the molecular interaction fields of the substituents. The descriptors produced are more detailed and specific than the original GRIND while still avoiding the bias introduced by the alignment. Three data sets have been studied to demonstrate the usefulness of the anchor-GRIND methodology for 3D-QSAR modeling. The two first data sets respectively include congeneric series of the hepatitis C virus NS3 protease and of the acetylcholinesterase inhibitors. The third data set discriminates between factor Xa inhibitors of high and low affinity. In all the series presented, the models obtained with the anchor-GRIND are statistically sound and easy to interpret.

	Abstract = { A method termed Median Partitioning (MP) has been developed to select
	diverse sets of molecules from large compound pools. Unlike many
	other methods for subset selection, the MP approach does not depend
	on pairwise comparison of molecules and can therefore be applied
	to very large compound collections. The only time limiting step is
	the calculation of molecular descriptors for database compounds.
	MP employs arrays of property descriptors with little correlation
	to divide large compound pools into partitions from which representative
	molecules can be selected. In each of n subsequent steps, a population
	of molecules is divided into subpopulations above and below the median
	value of a property descriptor until a desired number of 2n partitions
	are obtained. For descriptor evaluation and selection, an entropy
	formulation was embedded in a genetic algorithm. MP has been applied
	here to generate a subset of the Available Chemicals Directory, and
	the results have been compared with cell-based partitioning. },

	Abstract = {Validation is a crucial aspect of any quantitative structure--activity relationship (QSAR) modeling. This paper examines one of the most popular validation criteria, leave-one-out cross-validated R2 (LOO q2). Often, a high value of this statistical characteristic (q2>0.5) is considered as a proof of the high predictive ability of the model. In this paper, we show that this assumption is generally incorrect. In the case of 3D QSAR, the lack of the correlation between the high LOO q2 and the high predictive ability of a QSAR model has been established earlier [Pharm. Acta Helv. 70 (1995) 149; J. Chemomet. 10 (1996) 95; J. Med. Chem. 41 (1998) 2553]. In this paper, we use two-dimensional (2D) molecular descriptors and k nearest neighbors (kNN) QSAR method for the analysis of several datasets. No correlation between the values of q2 for the training set and predictive ability for the test set was found for any of the datasets. Thus, the high value of LOO q2 appears to be the necessary but not the sufficient condition for the model to have a high predictive power. We argue that this is the general property of QSAR models developed using LOO cross-validation. We emphasize that the external validation is the only way to establish a reliable QSAR model. We formulate a set of criteria for evaluation of predictive ability of QSAR models.},

	Abstract = {Libraries of chemical structures are used in a variety of cheminformatics tasks such as virtual screening and QSAR modeling and are generally characterized using molecular descriptors. When working with libraries it is useful to understand the distribution of compounds in the space defined by a set of descriptors. We present a simple approach to the analysis of the spatial distribution of the compounds in a library in general and outlier detection in particular based on counts of neighbors within a series of increasing radii. The resultant curves, termed R-NN curves, appear to follow a logistic model for any given descriptor space, which we justify theoretically for the 2D case. The method can be applied to data sets of arbitrary dimensions. The R-NN curves provide a visual method to easily detect compounds lying in a sparse region of a given descriptor space. We also present a method to numerically characterize the R-NN curves thus allowing identification of outliers in a single plot. },

	Abstract = {We present a method to measure the relative importance of the descriptors present in a QSAR model developed with a computational neural network (CNN). The approach is based on a sensitivity analysis of the descriptors. We tested the method on three published data sets for which linear and CNN models were previously built. The original work reported interpretations for the linear models, and we compare the results of the new method to the importance of descriptors in the linear models as described by a PLS technique. The results indicate that the proposed method is able to rank descriptors such that important descriptors in the CNN model correspond to the important descriptors in the linear model.},

	Abstract = {This work presents the development of Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR) models to predict the biological activity of 179 artemisinin analogues. The structures of the molecules are represented by chemical descriptors that encode topological, geometric, and electronic structure features. Both linear (multiple linear regression) and nonlinear (computational neural network) models are developed to link the structures to their reported biological activity. The best linear model was subjected to a PLS analysis to provide model interpretability. While the best linear model does not perform as well as the nonlinear model in terms of predictive ability, the application of PLS analysis allows for a sound physical interpretation of the structure-activity trend captured by the model. On the other hand, the best nonlinear model is superior in terms of pure predictive ability, having a training error of 0.47 log RA units (R2 = 0.96) and a prediction error of 0.76 log RA units (R2 = 0.88).},

@article{Itskowitz:2005aa,
	Abstract = { Variable selection k Nearest Neighbor (kNN) QSAR is a popular nonlinear
	methodology for building correlation models between chemical descriptors
	of compounds and biological activities. The models are built by finding
	a subspace of the original descriptor space where activity of each
	compound in the data set is most accurately predicted as the averaged
	activity of its k nearest neighbors in this subspace. We have formulated
	the problem of searching for the optimized kNN QSAR models with the
	highest predictive power as a variational problem. We have investigated
	the relative contribution of several model parameters such as the
	selection of variables, the number (k) of nearest neighbors, and
	the shape of the weighting function used to evaluate the contributions
	of k nearest neighbor compound activities to the predicted activity
	of each compound. We have derived the expression for the weighting
	function which maximizes the model performance. This optimization
	methodology was applied to several experimental data sets divided
	into the training and test sets. We report a significant improvement
	of both the leave-one-out cross-validated R2 (q2) for the training
	sets and predictive R2 of the test sets in all cases. Depending on
	the data set, the average improvements in the prediction accuracy
	(prediction R2) for the test sets ranged between 1.1\% and 94\% and
	for the training sets (q2) between 3.5\% and 118\%. We also describe
	a modified computational procedure for model building based on the
	use of relational databases to store descriptors and calculate compounds'
	similarities, which simplifies calculations and increases their efficiency.},

	Abstract = {Abstract: A quantitative structure-property relationship (QSPR) investigation
	was performed to develop a mathematical link between molecular structure
	and the clearing temperature of a series of structurally related
	liquid crystals. Molecular structures were encoded by a series of
	numerical descriptors encoding information regarding size, shape,
	and the ability to participate in intermolecular interactions. A
	genetic algorithm feature selection routine was utilized to select
	high-quality subsets of these descriptors for use in computational
	neural network models. A successful 10-descriptor model was developed
	using 318 compounds with a root-mean-square error of 5.4 K for the
	clearing temperature for the compounds in an external prediction
	set not used in model development.},

	Abstract = {Abstract: Adsorption of six acidic and four basic pesticides was measured
	in nine temperate soils. In general, sorption of acids was weak as
	compared to bases and followed the order dicamba < metsulfuron-methyl
	< fluazifop-P < metribuzin < 2,4-D < flupyrsulfuron-methyl < fluroxypyr
	< terbutryn < pirimicarb < fenpropimorph. Adsorption was negatively
	correlated with soil pH and positively correlated with organic carbon
	content. Statistical analysis against a wide range of soil and pesticide
	descriptors was used to identify the best combination of properties
	that describes the variation in adsorption. A regression equation
	including Log D (lipophilicity corrected for pH), the soil organic
	carbon content, and a pesticide descriptor (related to the van der
	Waals volume) was selected to predict the adsorption of acids (r2
	= 72.1% on an independent dataset). The behavior of bases was more
	complex, and approaches specific to each compound seem to be required.

	Abstract = {We report the development of a robust and general model for the prediction
	of melting points. It is based on a diverse data set of 4173 compounds
	and employs a large number of 2D and 3D descriptors to capture molecular
	physicochemical and other graph-based properties. Dimensionality
	reduction is performed by principal component analysis, while a fully
	connected feed-forward back-propagation artificial neural network
	is employed for model generation. The melting point is a fundamental
	physicochemical property of a molecule that is controlled by both
	single-molecule properties and intermolecular interactions due to
	packing in the solid state. Thus, it is difficult to predict, and
	previously only melting point models for clearly defined and smaller
	compound sets have been developed. Here we derive the first general
	model that covers a comparatively large and relevant part of organic
	chemical space. The final model is based on 2D descriptors, which
	are found to contain more relevant information than the 3D descriptors
	calculated. Internal random validation of the model achieves a correlation
	coefficient of R(2) = 0.661 with an average absolute error of 37.6
	degrees C. The model is internally consistent with a correlation
	coefficient of the test set of Q(2) = 0.658 (average absolute error
	38.2 degrees C) and a correlation coefficient of the internal validation
	set of Q(2) = 0.645 (average absolute error 39.8 degrees C). Additional
	validation was performed on an external drug data set consisting
	of 277 compounds. On this external data set a correlation coefficient
	of Q(2) = 0.662 (average absolute error 32.6 degrees C) was achieved,
	showing ability of the model to generalize. Compared to an earlier
	model for the prediction of melting points of druglike compounds
	our model exhibits slightly improved performance, despite the much
	larger chemical space covered. The remaining model error is due to
	molecular properties that are not captured using single-molecule
	based descriptors, namely both inter- and intramolecular interactions
	and crystal packing, for which examples of and reasons for outliers
	are given.},

	Abstract = {The Internet is a comprehensive resource of chemical information which
	is at the same time largely unstructured. It provides a wealth of
	scientific information such as experimental data and requires a suitable
	automated data mining and analysis tool for its meaningful exploration.
	The Java based software presented here, ChemXtreme, is developed
	for harvesting chemical information from the Internet employing the
	Google API in combination with a distributed client/server text analysis
	architecture based on JavaRMI. It represents the first and until
	now the only toolkit for automated structured data retrieval from
	the Internet which is itself open source. ChemXtreme employs the
	"search the search engine" strategy, where the URLs returned from
	the search engine are analyzed further via textual pattern analysis.
	This process resembles the manual analysis of the hit list, where
	relevant data are captured and, by means of human intervention, are
	mined into a format suitable for further analysis. ChemXtreme on
	the other hand transforms chemical information automatically into
	a structured format suitable for storage in databases and further
	analysis and also provides links to the original information source.
	The query data retrieved from the search engine by the server is
	encoded, encrypted, and compressed and then sent to all the participating
	active clients in the network for parsing. Relevant information identified
	by the clients on the retrieved Web sites is sent back to the server,
	verified, and added to the database for data mining and further analysis.
	The distributed further analysis of URLs in a client/server architecture
	scales very favorably, thus producing only minimal overhead.},

	Abstract = { A novel method, total pharmacophore diversity (ToPD), based on known
	pharmacophore features for numerically defining molecular similarity
	or diversity is described. The method captures the 3D shape and functionality
	of molecules by the analysis of relevant intramolecular distances
	to generate a short and descriptive pharmacophoric fingerprint for
	each molecule. The ToPD fingerprints can then be used in diversity
	analysis, clustering, or database searching. Conformational sampling
	is carried out when needed by the means of molecular dynamics. Our
	results show that ToPD outperforms a traditional 2D fingerprint technique
	in all test cases. },

@article{Nettles2006,
	Abstract = {Bridging chemical and biological space is the key to drug discovery
	and development. Typically, cheminformatics methods operate under
	the assumption that similar chemicals have similar biological activity.
	Ideally then, one could predict a drug's biological function(s) given
	only its chemical structure by similarity searching in libraries
	of compounds with known activities. In practice, effectively choosing
	a similarity metric is case dependent. This work compares both 2D
	and 3D chemical descriptors as tools for predicting the biological
	targets of ligand probes, on the basis of their similarity to reference
	molecules in a 46,000 compound, biologically annotated chemical database.
	Overall, we found that the 2D methods employed here outperform the
	3D (88\% vs 67\% success) in correct target prediction. However,
	the 3D descriptors proved superior in cases of probes with low structural
	similarity to other compounds in the database (singletons). Additionally,
	the 3D method (FEPOPS) shows promise for providing pharmacophoric
	alignment of the small molecules' chemical features consistent with
	those seen in experimental ligand/ receptor complexes. These results
	suggest that querying annotated chemical databases with a systematic
	combination of both 2D and 3D descriptors will prove more effective
	than employing single methods.},

@article{Nettles2007,
	Abstract = {Development of a pharmacophore hypothesis related to small-molecule
	activity is pivotal to chemical optimization of a series, since it
	defines features beneficial or detrimental to activity. Although
	crystal structures may provide detailed 3D interaction information
	for one molecule with its receptor, docking a different ligand to
	that model often leads to unreliable results due to protein flexibility.
	Graham Richards' lab was one of the first groups to utilize "fuzzy"
	pattern recognition algorithms taken from the field of image processing
	to solve problems in protein modeling. Thus, descriptor "fuzziness"
	was partly able to emulate conformational flexibility of the target
	while simultaneously enhancing the speed of the search. In this work,
	we extend these developments to a ligand-based method for describing
	and aligning molecules in flexible chemical space termed FEature
	POint PharmacophoreS (FEPOPS), which allows exploration of dynamic
	biological space. We develop a novel, combinatorial algorithm for
	molecular comparisons and evaluate it using the WOMBAT dataset. The
	new approach shows superior retrospective virtual screening performance
	than earlier shape-based or charge-based algorithms. Additionally,
	we use target prediction to evaluate how FEPOPS alignments match
	the molecules biological activity by identifying the atoms and features
	that make the key contributions to overall chemical similarity. Overall,
	we find that FEPOPS are sufficiently fuzzy and flexible to find not
	only new ligand scaffolds, but also challenging molecules that occupy
	different conformational states of dynamic biological space as from
	induced fits.},

@article{Nigsch:2006aa,
	Abstract = {We have applied the k-nearest neighbor (kNN) modeling technique to
	the prediction of melting points. A data set of 4119 diverse organic
	molecules (data set 1) and an additional set of 277 drugs (data set
	2) were used to compare performance in different regions of chemical
	space, and we investigated the influence of the number of nearest
	neighbors using different types of molecular descriptors. To compute
	the prediction on the basis of the melting temperatures of the nearest
	neighbors, we used four different methods (arithmetic and geometric
	average, inverse distance weighting, and exponential weighting),
	of which the exponential weighting scheme yielded the best results.
	We assessed our model via a 25-fold Monte Carlo cross-validation
	(with approximately 30\% of the total data as a test set) and optimized
	it using a genetic algorithm. Predictions for drugs based on drugs
	(separate training and test sets each taken from data set 2) were
	found to be considerably better [root-mean-squared error (RMSE)=46.3
	degrees C, r2=0.30] than those based on nondrugs (prediction of data
	set 2 based on the training set from data set 1, RMSE=50.3 degrees
	C, r2=0.20). The optimized model yields an average RMSE as low as
	46.2 degrees C (r2=0.49) for data set 1, and an average RMSE of 42.2
	degrees C (r2=0.42) for data set 2. It is shown that the kNN method
	inherently introduces a systematic error in melting point prediction.
	Much of the remaining error can be attributed to the lack of information
	about interactions in the liquid state, which are not well-captured
	by molecular descriptors.},

@article{Pearlman:1999aa,
	Abstract = { Following brief comments regarding the advantages of cell-based diversity
	algorithms and the selection of low-dimensional chemistry-space metrics
	needed to implement such algorithms, the notion of metric validation
	is discussed. Activity-seeded, structure-based clustering is presented
	as an ideal approach for the validation of either high- or low-dimensional
	chemistry-space metrics when validation by computer-graphic visualization
	is not possible. Whereas typical methods for reducing the dimensionality
	of chemistry-space inevitably discard potentially important information,
	we present a simple yet novel algorithm for reducing dimensionality
	by identifying which axes (metrics) convey information related to
	affinity for a given receptor and which axes can be safely discarded
	as being irrelevant to the given receptor. This algorithm often reveals
	a three- or two-dimensional subspace of a (typically six-dimensional)
	BCUT chemistry-space and, thus, enables computer graphic visualization
	of the actual coordinates of active compounds and combinatorial libraries.
	Most significantly, we illustrate the importance of using receptor-relevant
	distances for identifying near neighbors of lead compounds, comparing
	libraries, and other diversity-related tasks. },

@article{Rush:2005aa,
	Abstract = {In this paper, we describe the first prospective application of the
	shape-comparison program ROCS (Rapid Overlay of Chemical Structures)
	to find new scaffolds for small molecule inhibitors of the ZipA-FtsZ
	protein-protein interaction, a proposed antibacterial target. The
	shape comparisons are made relative to the crystallographically determined,
	bioactive conformation of a high-throughput screening (HTS) hit.
	The use of ROCS led to the identification of a set of novel, weakly
	binding inhibitors with scaffolds presenting synthetic opportunities
	to further optimize biological affinity and lacking development issues
	associated with the HTS lead. These ROCS-identified scaffolds would
	have been missed using other structural similarity approaches such
	as ISIS 2D fingerprints. X-ray crystallographic analysis of one of
	the new inhibitors bound to ZipA reveals that the shape comparison
	approach very accurately predicted the binding mode. These experimental
	results validate this use of ROCS for chemotype switching or "lead
	hopping" and suggest that it is of general interest for lead identification
	in drug discovery endeavors.},

	models that are able to classify compounds as active or inactive

	been tested against progressively more challenging validation sets
	where steps are taken to ensure that compounds in the validation
	set are chemically and structurally distinct from the training set.
	In the most challenging example, we simulate a lead-hopping experiment
	by excluding an entire class of compounds (defined by a core substructure)
	from the training set. The left-out active compounds comprised approximately
	40\% of the actives. The model trained on the remaining compounds
	is able to recall 75\% of the actives from the "new" lead series
	while correctly classifying >99\% of the 5000 inactives included
	in the validation set.},

@article{Sheridan:2004aa,
	Abstract = {How well can a QSAR model predict the activity of a molecule not in
	the training set used to create the model? A set of retrospective
	cross-validation experiments using 20 diverse in-house activity sets
	were done to find a good discriminator of prediction accuracy as
	measured by root-mean-square difference between observed and predicted
	activity. Among the measures we tested, two seem useful: the similarity
	of the molecule to be predicted to the nearest molecule in the training
	set and/or the number of neighbors in the training set, where neighbors
	are those more similar than a user-chosen cutoff. The molecules with
	the highest similarity and/or the most neighbors are the best-predicted.
	This trend holds true for narrow training sets and, to a lesser degree,
	for many diverse training sets and does not depend on which QSAR
	method or descriptor is used. One may define the similarity using
	a different descriptor than that used for the QSAR model. The similarity
	dependence for diverse training sets is somewhat unexpected. It appears
	to be greater for those data sets where the association of similar
	activities vs similar structures (as encoded in the Patterson plot)
	is stronger. We propose a way to estimate the reliability of the
	prediction of an arbitrary chemical structure on a given QSAR model,
	given the training set from which the model was derived.},

@article{Skrobot:2005aa,
	Abstract = { Chemometric data analysis tools were applied to chromatographic data
	to identify the presence of solvents in gasoline samples from gas
	stations in Minas Gerais state, Brazil. A training set of 75 samples
	was formulated by mixing pure gasoline with various concentrations
	of four complex solvents. The samples were analyzed by GC-MS, and
	the selected peaks were used in chemometric studies. Hierarchical
	cluster analysis, HCA, was used to search for sample distribution
	patterns according to the solvent added. K-nearest neighbor (KNN)
	was used to create a classification scheme to differentiate pure
	and mixed samples and to indicate the type of solvent present. HCA
	revealed a clear clustering tendency of samples containing the same
	solvent. However, only after the exclusion of lesser variables (peaks)
	by means of Fisher weights was it possible to separate samples with
	low solvent concentrations. After optimization of the KNN algorithm,
	it was possible to classify 88\% of the samples of the training set
	correctly. To check the quality of the model, another group of samples
	was prepared with certified gasoline and the same solvents. The algorithm
	classified the great majority of the samples correctly once again.},

@article{Souza:2004aa,
	Abstract = { The AM1 semiempirical method is employed to calculate a set of molecular
	properties (variables) of 45 flavone compounds with antipicornavirus
	activity, and 9 new flavone molecules are used for an activity prediction
	study. Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Hierarchical Cluster Analysis
	(HCA), Stepwise Discriminant Analysis (SDA), and K-Nearest Neighbor
	(KNN) are employed in order to reduce dimensionality and investigate
	which subset of variables should be more effective for classifying
	the flavone compounds according to their degree of antipicornavirus
	activity. The PCA, HCA, SDA, and KNN methods showed that the variables
	MR (molar refractivity), B9 (bond order between C9 and C10 atoms),
	and B25 (bond order between C11 and R7 atoms) are important properties
	for the separation between active and inactive flavone compounds,
	and this fact reveals that electronic and steric effects are relevant
	when one is trying to understand the interaction between flavone
	compounds with antipicornavirus activity and the biological receptor.
	In the activity prediction study, using the PCA, HCA, SDA, and KNN
	methodologies, three of the 9 new flavone compounds studied were
	classified as potentially active against picornaviruses. },

@article{Spjuth:2007aa,
	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: There is a need for software applications that provide
	users with a complete and extensible toolkit for chemo- and bioinformatics
	accessible from a single workbench. Commercial packages are expensive
	and closed source, hence they do not allow end users to modify algorithms
	and add custom functionality. Existing open source projects are more
	focused on providing a framework for integrating existing, separately
	installed bioinformatics packages, rather than providing user-friendly
	interfaces. No open source chemoinformatics workbench has previously
	been published, and no successful attempts have been made to integrate
	chemo- and bioinformatics into a single framework. RESULTS: Bioclipse
	is an advanced workbench for resources in chemo- and bioinformatics,
	such as molecules, proteins, sequences, spectra, and scripts. It
	provides 2D-editing, 3D-visualization, file format conversion, calculation
	of chemical properties, and much more; all fully integrated into
	a user-friendly desktop application. Editing supports standard functions
	such as cut and paste, drag and drop, and undo/redo. Bioclipse is
	written in Java and based on the Eclipse Rich Client Platform with
	a state-of-the-art plugin architecture. This gives Bioclipse an advantage
	over other systems as it can easily be extended with functionality
	in any desired direction. CONCLUSION: Bioclipse is a powerful workbench
	for bio- and chemoinformatics as well as an advanced integration
	platform. The rich functionality, intuitive user interface, and powerful
	plugin architecture make Bioclipse the most advanced and user-friendly
	open source workbench for chemo- and bioinformatics. Bioclipse is
	released under Eclipse Public License (EPL), an open source license
	which sets no constraints on external plugin licensing; it is totally
	open for both open source plugins as well as commercial ones. Bioclipse
	is freely available at http://www.bioclipse.net.},

@article{Sutherland:2003aa,
	Abstract = {Classification methods allow for the development of structure-activity relationship models when the target property is categorical rather than continuous. We describe a classification method which fits descriptor splines to activities, with descriptors selected using a genetic algorithm. This method, which we identify as SFGA, is compared to the well-established techniques of recursive partitioning (RP) and soft independent modeling by class analogy (SIMCA) using five series of compounds: cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors, benzodiazepine receptor (BZR) ligands, estrogen receptor (ER) ligands, dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) inhibitors, and monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors. Only 1-D and 2-D descriptors were used. Approximately 40% of compounds in each series were assigned to a test set, "cherry-picked" from the complete set such that they lie outside the training set as much as possible. SFGA produced models that were more predictive for all but the DHFR set, for which SIMCA was most predictive. RP gave the least predictive models for all but the MAO set. A similar trend was observed when using training and test sets to which compounds were randomly assigned and when gradually eliminating compounds from the (designed) training set. The stability of models was examined for the random and reduced sets, where stability means that classification statistics and the selected descriptors are similar for models derived from different sets. Here, SIMCA produced the most stable models, followed by SFGA and RP. We show that a consensus approach that combines all three methods outperforms the single best model for all data sets.},

@article{Tarca:2005aa,
	Abstract = {Abstract: The design of reliable data-driven classifiers able to predict
	flow regimes in trickle beds or bed initial behavior (contraction/expansion)
	in three-phase fluidized beds requires as a first step the identification
	of a restrained number of salient variables among all the numerous
	available features. Reduction of dimensionality of the feature space
	is urged by the fact that lesser training samples may be required
	and/or more reliable estimates for the classifier parameters may
	be achieved and/or improvement in accuracy can be achieved. This
	work investigates several methodologies to identify the relevant
	features in two classification problems belonging to a multiphase
	reactor context. Relevance of the subsets was assessed using mutual
	information between the subsets and the class variable (filter approach)
	and by the accuracy rate of a one-nearest neighbor classifier (wrapper
	approach). Algorithms for generating feasible sets to maximize these
	relevance criteria that were investigated were the sequential forward
	selection and the plus-l-take away r. Another conceptually different
	method to feature ranking that was tested was based on the Garson's
	saliency indices derived from the weights of classification neural
	networks. Reliability of the feature selection methodologies was
	first evaluated on two benchmark problems (a synthetic problem and
	the Anderson's iris data). They were henceforth applied to the two
	multiphase reactors classification problems with the goal of identifying
	the most appropriate features subsets to be used into classifiers.
	Finally, a new feature selection algorithm which combines filter
	and wrapper techniques proved to yield the same solutions as the
	wrapper technique while being less computationally expensive.},

	Abstract = {There have recently been developments in the methods used to access
	the accuracy of the prediction and applicability domain of absorption,
	distribution, metabolism, excretion and toxicity models, and also
	in the methods used to predict the physicochemical properties of
	compounds in the early stages of drug development. The methods are
	classified into two main groups: those based on the analysis of similarity
	of molecules, and those based on the analysis of calculated properties.
	An analysis of octanol-water distribution coefficients is used to
	exemplify the consistency of estimated and calculated accuracy of
	the ALOGPS program (http://www.vcclab.org) to predict in-house and
	publicly available datasets.},

@article{Walker:2005aa,
	Abstract = {This paper describes the Skin Irritation Corrosion Rules Estimation Tool (SICRET) that was developed to allow others to estimate whether their chemicals are likely to cause skin irritation or skin corrosion. SICRET uses physicochemical property limits to identify chemicals with no skin corrosion or skin irritation potential. If a chemical's physicochemical properties do not meet the prescribed limits to identify chemicals with no skin corrosion or skin irritation potential, then the chemical's structural alerts are used to identify chemicals with skin corrosion or skin irritation potential. If a chemical does not contain structural alerts that indicate it has skin corrosion or skin irritation potential, then in vitro skin corrosion or skin irritation testing is conducted. If the in vitro skin corrosion or skin irritation testing is positive, then the data are included in feedback loops for development of new structural alerts to identify chemicals with skin corrosion or skin irritation potential. If in vitro testing for skin corrosion or skin irritation is negative then the data are included in feedback loops for development of new physicochemical property limits to identify chemicals with no skin corrosion or skin irritation potential. The use of in-vitro tests was proposed as a safety net to identify either new structural alerts for chemicals with skin corrosion or skin irritation potential or new physicochemical property limits for chemicals with no skin corrosion or skin irritation potential. In summary, SICRET is a tiered approach that uses physicochemical property limits, structural alerts and in-vitro tests to classify chemicals that cause skin irritation or skin corrosion without further animal testing.},

@article{Yamashita:2006aa,
	Abstract = {It is a difficult task to recognize the trends in molecular physical properties relevant to a specific chemical class and find a way to optimize potential compounds. We present here a novel hierarchical data visualization technique, named ``HeiankyoView'', to visualize large-scale multidimensional chemical information. HeiankyoView represents hierarchically organized data objects by mapping leaf nodes as colored square icons and nonleaf nodes as rectangular borders. In this way, data objects can be expressed as equishaped icons without overlapping one another in the two-dimensional display space. HeiankyoView has been applied to visualize aqueous solubility data for 908 compounds collected from the published literature. When the results of a recursive partitioning analysis and hierarchical clustering analysis were visualized, the trends hidden in the solubility data could be effectively displayed as intuitively understandable visual images. Most interestingly, the data visualization technique, without any statistical computations, was able to assist us in extracting from such large-scale data meaningful information establishing that ClogP and the molecular weight are critical factors in determining aqueous solubility. Thus, HeiankyoView is a powerful tool to help us understand structure−activity relationships intuitively from a large-scale data set.},

@article{Zhang:2006aa,
	Abstract = {In the body, cell monolayers serve as permeability barriers, determining
	transport of molecules from one organ or tissue compartment to another.
	After oral drug administration, for example, transport across the
	epithelial cell monolayer lining the lumen of the intestine determines
	the fraction of drug in the gut that is absorbed by the body. By
	modeling passive transcellular transport properties in the presence
	of an apical to basolateral concentration gradient, we demonstrate
	how a computational, cell-based molecular transport simulator can
	be used to define a physicochemical property space occupied by molecules
	with desirable permeability and intracellular retention characteristics.
	Considering extracellular domains of cell surface receptors located
	on the opposite side of a cell monolayer as a drug's desired site
	of action, simulation of transcellular transport can be used to define
	the physicochemical properties of molecules with maximal transcellular
	permeability but minimal intracellular retention. Arguably, these
	molecules would possess very desirable features: least likely to
	exhibit nonspecific toxicity, metabolism, and side effects associated
	with high (undesirable) intracellular accumulation; and most likely
	to exhibit favorable bioavailability and efficacy associated with
	maximal rates of transport across cells and minimal intracellular
	retention, resulting in (desirable) accumulation at the extracellular
	site of action. Simulated permeability values showed good correlations
	with PAMPA, Caco-2, and intestinal permeability measurements, without
	"training" the model and without resorting to statistical regression
	techniques to "fit" the data. Therefore, cell-based molecular transport
	simulators could be useful in silico screening tools for chemical
	genomics and drug discovery.},
